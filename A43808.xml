            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THat there was just Cauſe for a Writing of this nature, I hope this Book it ſelf will convince even his Lordſhip himſelf; but how I came to be engaged in it, perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:49695:3"/>the Curious may deſire to know, and I think it reaſonable enough to ſatisfie them.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip had been well aſſured by ſome of his moſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Clergy, that the integrity of his Faith was under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuſpicion, for cauſes which I ſhall think fit to ſuppreſs. And this did ſo ſenſibly affect him, that thenceforward all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Diſcourſes ſeem'd poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi> to work off the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of his Clergy. And truly this ſeemed to be, not only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb facs="tcp:49695:3"/>but an effectual Eſſay hereunto, which he offered in the Oral Diſcourſe on the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Death of Chriſt, of which I my ſelf was an Auditor at <hi>Warminſter</hi> in the Year <hi>1693,</hi> being led thither by a ſtrong deſire to know the Senſes of ſo great a Prelate, on thoſe Points which have employ'd my Theories for above Twenty Seven Years.</p>
            <p>And truly, as it was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, it gave a general Joy and Satisfaction to the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona of the Clergy, and to my
<pb facs="tcp:49695:4"/>ſelf alſo; for though there were ſome little failures, I attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe to the inevitable looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a preſent effuſion, ſince all the ſubſtance ſeemed even heartily Orthodox and Chriſtian, without any indecencies toward the Fathers, or flouts at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Notions or Forms; and with moſt paſſionate concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Socinian</hi> Impieties. For though, indeed, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Foreign <hi>Socinians</hi> for their Morals, yet ours he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned for a rout of profligate and irreligious Villains. Inſomuch, that I not only ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:49695:4"/>thanked his Lordſhip, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a worthy Favourite of his Lordſhip's to beſpeak the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that the whole Church might rejoyce with us together, that ſo Great and Learned a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſo publickly and ſolidly aſſerted that Faith, which he was ſuppoſed really to deſpiſe. And not only ſo, but I every where celebrated his Integrity and Learning among my Friends, that upon my account they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their prejudices againſt him, which ſeveral other Mens fair Character had not been able to remove.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49695:5"/>
            <p>But when I ſaw the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as it came new dreſſed from the Preſs, I was quite confounded by a complication of paſſions and amazements at the Changes made in it, eſpecially by the unfriendly uſage of the Fathers,<note n="*">Preface to the Clergy.</note> and the gaudy Character of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Probity, Juſtice, and Charity. Being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, no wonder if my heart was heated within me. And hereupon I undertook to write to his Lordſhip my grief at thoſe Paſſages which offended me, and another particular practice of
<pb facs="tcp:49695:5"/>his Lordſhip not to be mentioned here. This Letter his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip reſented very grievouſly as too free and daring, and for that Cauſe wrote to me, that he would admit of no diſcuſſion of particulars with a Man of my ill temper, who ſeemed made to exerciſe the patience of better Men. But had I come and modeſtly propoſed my exceptions, he could and would have given me ſatisfaction; but if I would to the Preſs for want of ſuch private ſatisfaction, (as I had forewarned his Lordſhip) I might take my Courſe, ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:49695:6"/>this Book comes out even with his Lordſhip's Licenſe.</p>
            <p>The Perſons near me, to whom the Letter was ſhown by his Lordſhip, on the account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of given at ſecond hand, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed judge the Letter bitter, and ſo I confeſs it was, not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny malignity in my temper, but in the matters charged on his Lordſhip. And to ſhew my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of his Honour, I did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to him, that I wrote it not with that Envy, through which ſome Men (forgetting his great merits) inſult on his failures,
<pb facs="tcp:49695:6"/>but that he might make ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments himſelf as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe aſſaults and cenſures, which otherwiſe muſt fall upon him. And to let him ſee, that it was written for Conſcience only, not for clamour, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to impart it to no Man living, nor ſhould any Perſon have ever known the leaſt apex of it, if his Lordſhip himſelf had not diſcovered it. Now whether his Lordſhip be indeed able to give me ſatisfaction as to the matters taxed in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I leave to him to try, and God and his Church to judge.
<pb facs="tcp:49695:7"/>But for the private practice I objected to him, I will at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſpare him; and if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will be ſo kind to himſelf, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the matter ſhall not only be huſhed up, but every ſoul his Clergy will love him with new fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>But as to his Doctrine it is gone abroad and cannot return. And if it be of evil influence on Young Students, or Men prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Irreligion, or of diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reflexion to the preſent Reign, or State of Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:49695:7"/>every Man has a juſt right fairly and bravely to oppoſe it, without fear of Men, or reſpect of Perſons; And if it be not ſo, I promiſe his Lordſhip the moſt publick Penance and Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>PART I.</head>
               <p n="1">§ 1. TWO Things I have to urge againſt my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his Diſcourſe on the Divinity and Death of Chriſt: One is, that he very defectively (to ſay no worſe) ſtates our Faith and Doctrine in the Articles of the Trinity and Incarnation, tho'<note n="*">P. 25.</note> he profeſſes it a Matter of the greateſt Importance for <hi>us to have our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning theſe, right and duly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> and tho' he expoſes the Fathers under the ſame and worſe Imputations, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49695:9"/>is the ſecond thing that offends. For he does not uncover any real failures in any particular Ancients, but cenſures their very Catholick and Eſtabliſhed Principles.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. This then is to be the firſt part of my Charge, That he foully ſtates the Faith of the Divinity and Incarnation of Chriſt, and therein of the Holy Trinity. Of which he tell us,<note n="†">P. 30, 31.</note> there have been three Opinions, to wit, the Socinian, the Arian; and then, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which I would have called the Catholick and Chriſtian Faith. Now his Lordſhip means, there have been theſe three Opinions either within, or without the Church Catholick; if within, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed here is an inſinuation laid for the Communion with Socinians and Arians, which is a bleſſed Comprehenſion; but if his Lordſhip means not within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church only, then he had been nearer the number, if he had ſaid there have been thirty Opinions in this Matter. But tho' this be inartificial enough, (if no more) yet that which is more grievouſly ſuſpicious is, that he calls the Catholick Faith, but a meer Opinion, and Perſwaſion of a Party.<note n="*">P. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>The third Opinion</hi> (ſaith his Lordſhip) <hi>is, that the Godhead by the Eternal Word, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49695:9"/>Second in the bleſſed Three, dwelt in, and was ſo inwardly united to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Jeſus Chriſt, that by Virtue of it God and Man were truly one Perſon, as our Soul and Body make one Man. And that the Eternal Word was truly God, and as ſuch is worſhipped and adored as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object of Divine Adoration. By thoſe of this Perſwaſion the Term Perſon became applied to the Three, which the Scripture only calls by the Name of Father, Son or Word, and Holy Ghoſt, on deſign to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe, who thought that theſe Three were only different Names of the ſame Thing. But by Perſon is not meant ſuch a Being as we commonly underſtand by that Word, a complete intelligent Being, but only that every one of that Bleſſed Three has a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſtinction in himſelf, by which he is truly different from the other two.</hi> So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note n="†">P. 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>This in general is the Sump of the received Doctrine, That as there is but One God, ſo in that undivided Eſſence, there are Three, that are really different from one another, and are more than three Names, or three out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Oeconomies,</hi>
                  <note n="*">P. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>[or Modes] and that the Second of theſe was in a most intimate and unconceivable manner united to a perfect Man; ſo that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49695:10"/>from the Humane and Divine Nature thus united, there did reſult the Perſon of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. And now perhaps ſome may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Exceptions lie againſt this; but there are indeed ſeveral, and thoſe of great Importance. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he calls it an Opinion only like that of the Socinian and Arian, while yet he intimates it to be the Doctrine of the Church. The truth is, as his Lordſhip has ſtated it, it has many meer Opinions in it; but they are ſuch as are not in the Faith, and ſo ought not to have been repreſented as the Doctrine of the Church. But if his Lordſhip had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it for the Chriſtian Faith, either as it is, or ought to have been ſtated by him, he ought not to have ſet it out as a meer Opinion or Perſwaſion of a third Party. For a meer partial Opinion cannot be a Divine or Catholick Faith, whether we take Opinion for the Act or Object of Opinion. For the Act is meer Humane Conjecture without certain grounds; and objectively Opinions are Propoſitions that have no certain, but only probable appearance, which therefore no Man is bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to aſſert, or ſtand by for want of certain Evidence and Authority. But Catholick Faith objectively taken conſiſts of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49695:10"/>certain Principles made certainly evident by Divine Revelation to the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and thereupon to be relied on, and aſſerted againſt all temptations in hopes of Life Eternal. Now theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thus received were the Faith of the Univerſal Church (not the Opinion of any Party) in the beginning; and therefore the contrary Parties and Opinions ariſing ſince (of what Cut or Size ſoever) pertain not to this Holy Body, in which the Faith of the Trinity truly ſtated is as eſſential as the Faith of the Unity, and as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the Chriſtian Profeſſions. Now would it not be very Theological to ſay, That all the Patriarchs, Prophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the whole Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Church of Chriſt were ever of this Opinion, That there is one God only the Creator and Governour of all things? That the Apoſtles and all Chriſtians are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Jeſus is the Chriſt? That it is our Opinion, That he came down and dwelt among us; died, roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven, and ſhall come to Judgment at the general Reſurrection? Juſt ſo abſurd it is to call the Catholick Faith of God's Church the Opinion or Perſwaſion of a Party. 'Tis true indeed, his Lordſhip ſometimes calls it Doctrine, but this term
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49695:11"/>is equivocal, and agrees as uſually to the Opinions of the Philoſophers. But what I require is, that the Catholick Doctrine be aſſerted as a Rule of Faith, which the Church is bound to adhere to on the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Authority of Divine Revelation; this Revelation appearing real not only to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men's private Opinions, but origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally committed to the Charge and Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the whole Church by the Apoſtles, and ſo preſerved by their Succeſſors throughout the whole diffuſive Body. Whereas his Lordſhip only lays down this Notion, or form of Faith,<note n="†">P. 26. See Diſcour. 3.</note> That we believe points of Doctrine, <hi>becauſe we are perſwaded, that they are revealed to us in Scripture;</hi> which is ſo languid and unſafe a Rule, that it will reſolve Faith into every Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fancies and contradictory Opinions; ſince each Man's Faith is his Perſwaſion, that what he believes for a Doctrine is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture. Whereas the Act of a Chriſtian Faith believes ſuch Doctrine to be true and fundamental in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the certain Evidence thereof in the Scriptures, acknowledged by all Churches not led by caſual Perſwaſions, but by a primitive, perpetual, univerſal, and unanimous Conviction and Tradition.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49695:11"/>The deviation from which Rule and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to private Opinions and Perſwaſions is the cauſe of all Hereſies, and by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Diviſions naturally tends to the ruine of the true Chriſtian and Catholick Faith. I will not however at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into that thicket of Controverſie, What Rules private Perſons are bound to in the learning and profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith; but whoſoever will arrive to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of Judgment and Knowledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, muſt betake him<note n="†">P. 63.</note> to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Rule of <hi>Vincentius Eiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

A Rule very practicable and eaſie, ſince there are ſufficient Memorials of the Primitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, delivering unto us their Creeds and Summaries of the then Catholick Faith, which from them has uniformly deſcended to all Churches of the later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. 'Tis true indeed, every ſingle Man can believe no otherwiſe than he is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately perſwaded; but he that is not to be perſwaded to receive the common and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Syſtems of the Faith of the Church Catholick, upon the Authority on which it hath ever ſtood, and yet ſtands, or ſhall wantonly coin out other Articles

               <p n="4">§. 4. Secondly, His Lordſhip is not clear in the point of Incarnation; for he tells us, <hi>that this third Opinion is, that by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Eternal Word with Chriſt's Humanity, God and Man truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one Perſon.</hi> Now here firſt we are not taught, whether there were three, or any one Perſon in the God-head before the Incarnation: For this account will admit the Perſonality of Chriſt to be founded firſt<note n="†">P. 32.</note> in the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to ſome of his Lordſhip's Criticks, (which he dares not contradict) who place the foundation of the Sonſhip in the lower Nature. Yea, this Deſcription will admit the Patripaſſian Hereſie of but one Perſon in the Deity: For if the Eternal Word were no Perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father, the Union thereof with the Humanity conſtitutes the Father an incarnate Perſon; or otherwiſe by this State of his Lordſhips Doctrine, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt may be conceived as one incarnate Perſon. Whereas his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip well knows our Faith to be clear, That
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49695:12"/>the Eternal Word is perſonally diſtinct, or a diſtinct Perſon from the Father, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone aſſumed the Humanity into a Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union with himſelf, and ſo alone was the Perſon of Chriſt exceptively of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt from this Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and Character.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Now if a Man would enquire into the Motives of this affected obſcurity in his Lordſhip, that leaves open a gap to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hereſies, his Lordſhip's Words would lead one to a concluſion, or at leaſt a fair jealouſie, that his Lordſhip does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Diſtinction really Perſonal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, Word, and Holy Spirit, but that the true and real Perſonality of Chriſt is proper to the Humane Nature. For he teacheth us, that thoſe whom the Church calleth Perſons, the Scripture only calls by the Names of Father, Son or Word, and Holy Ghoſt. Where that artificial Word only derogates from the propriety and fitneſs of the term Perſon, as if the Scripture terms did not come up to it, nor juſtifie it. And if his Lordſhip will ſtand by the<note n="†">P. 45.</note> plain inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Words elſewhere, he places Chriſt's Perſonality only in his Manhood in theſe words; <hi>That Divine Perſon in whom dwelt the Eternal Word.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49695:13"/>So that the Word muſt be different from the Perſon in whom it dwelt, which muſt be the Hereſie of <hi>Sabellius, Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

But when he ſays this third Opinion is, than by the Incarnation God and Man truly became one Perſon. I would fain know, whether the term Perſon be proper for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or no? If not, the Doctrine is to be blamed, that teaches him to be truly one Perſon, ſince the truth of a Character is the greateſt propriety; and if it be not true, the Doctrine that teaches it is to be caſhiered: But if, to avoid this, it be true, then I would fain be inſtructed, whether the Church does not uſe the term Perſon in the ſame formal intention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, when She calls them three Perſons, as She does when She calls Chriſt, or the Son of God incarnate a Perſon? For if She uſes the term in the ſame formal intention, then if the Chriſt be a proper Perſon, ſo are the Father, and Holy Spirit two other Perſons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49695:13"/>properly and truly diſtinct in the ſenſe of the Church; but if the Church has one intention in the Term, when applied to Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p n="6">§. 6. But the Order of his Lordſhip's Diſcourſe obliges me to break off a little from this Diſquiſition till the next Section, where we muſt reſume it. For he tells us, (if we will believe him) that the term Perſon by thoſe of our Perſwaſion came to be applied to the three, to diſcover thoſe who thought that theſe three were different names of the ſame thing, which were for the moſt part, and were generally called Patripaſſians, and were expelled as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from the Church. Now wherein lay their Hereſie? Why in this, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt were not three co-eſſential Perſons really diſtinct, which was the Catholick Faith; inſtead of which they coined this pretence, That thoſe Names had not three diſtinct ſubjects of which they were predicates or denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but only were three titles of God the Father, who became incarnate and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us. Now hence it appears, that their Hereſie conſiſted in the denial of what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49695:14"/>was ever before received in the Church, That the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt were three Perſons. And if ſo, then is his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's inſinuation falſe and injurious, that the term Perſon had its riſe and occaſion from Patripaſſianiſm, and conſequently is of a later Date, that by this fraudulent Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochroniſm the term, and the ſenſe of it may be taken for not Primitive and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, but a mere later and artificial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.

For the truth hereof I ſhall recite the Words<note n="†">Athan. con. Sabell. Greg. <gap reason="foreign">

From whence it appears, that the <hi>Sabellians</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but one Perſon againſt that Plurality of Perſons fore-acknowledged in the Church. And now I leave it to his Lordſhip to explain how the denial of three Perſons could be Apoſtaſie, as this Father calls it, had not the Faith of them been before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly avowed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For Hereſie is an oppoſition of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Faith, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie muſt be from an antecedent Profeſſion. So that the Doctrine of a Perſonal Trinity was not later than Patripaſſianiſm, but the Original Faith.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49695:15"/>Nor does his Lordſhip ſeem candid in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing this, which was the ſubſtance of that Hereſie, while he mentions only their teaching three Names of one thing or Perſon, which was a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">§ 7. Now that my Surmiſes againſt his Lordſhip's Integrity herein are well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, will appear from his Lordſhip's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of this Term; which tho' it be received in the third Party, yet he dares not make his own, nor allow for proper. <hi>By Perſon</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is only meant that every one of that Bleſſed Three has a peculiar diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in himſelf, by which he is truly different from the other Two.</hi> Here it is plain that by uſing the Term Three ſo often, without adding Perſon, he ſhuns the Word as much as he dares at preſent to do, and aſſigns a diſtinction which is not any way perſonal.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49695:16"/>For it being only ſuch a diverſity that one is not the other, it will as well agree to two or three Tobaco pipes; for theſe are truly different from each other. I would therefore ask his Lordſhip, Does the Name of Father, as diſtinct from the Son, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no more than that one is not the other, or does it import a Perſonality really Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal? If he will grant only the former part of the disjunction, (as he grants no more in his Diſcourſe) then there really was no God the Father from Eternity till the Creation of Chriſt, which was the firſt Article of Arianiſm; nor was he, who is by all called God the Father, even a true Perſon, which yet however all have ever acknowledged. But if he ever was a true Perſon and Father, then firſt as to him the Term is elder than Patripaſſianiſm; and I demand a good reaſon, why the Eternal Word is not as much and as true a Perſon alſo, eſpecially if he be the Eternal Son of the Eternal Father? For otherwiſe the Father and the Son will be of Dignities ſpecifically different, if one be of a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the other of imperſonal Character; tho' how a real Son can be a thing really imperſonal I cannot conceive; and then be that allows no more diſtinction but only this, that one is not the other, tacitly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49695:16"/>denying the relative diſtinction between Father and the Son, doth really deny both the Father and the Son. When theſe Words were orally delivered at <hi>Warmiſter,</hi> I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to my ſelf, but looked on it as a ſlip only of an extemporary ſpeaking; but when I ſee it alſo after the laſt conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction delivered from the Preſs, I ſuſpect ſomewhat more than ſhould be; I am ſure the Dictate is rotten, and tacitly imports a renunciation of our Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. And yet after all, ſo great is the force of Truth, that it will maintain its Evidence, even in the Tongues and Pens of its Adverſaries. For though ſome part of his Lordſhip's Doctrines denies the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, yet others unwittingly concede it. For firſt of all, when he calls the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the Bleſſed Three, not daring to ſay Perſons, the Character of Bleſſed doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Peal Perſonality. For whether it be taken for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſenſe of God's eſſential Happineſs, or in the ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the objects of our religious Praiſes; yet if the Three are either, or both ways Bleſſed, they muſt be Perſons. For among created Beings, none are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally or effectually bleſſed, but what are Perſonal; but if any Man will cavil, and ſay, that God in the Creation bleſſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49695:17"/>things Imperſonal, and promiſed ſuch Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings alſo in the Moſaical Covenants; it is enough to reply, That theſe Bleſſed Three are uncapable of thoſe lower forms of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and muſt have a Divine Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they are of a Divine Nature. Now his Lordſhip will not ſay, that theſe are Three Diſtinct Bleſſed Eſſences, and he ſays they are more than three Names, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies, or Modes; ſo that he cannot with conſiſtence call them three Bleſſed Names, Oeconomies, or Modes; and then what can he or any one elſe conceive by Three Bleſſed, but Three Bleſſed Perſons? For though it may be truly ſaid, that the higheſt Bleſſedneſs is that of Eſſence, yet none but a Perſon, or Perſons can be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Bleſſed. So that his Lordſhip aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Bleſſed Three, muſt againſt his will yield them to be three Perſons really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, though not divide, And ſo, when he ſays, that every one of that Bleſſed Three has a peculiar diſtinction in himſelf, this Pronoun [himſelf] is expreſly Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and ſo either the Perſonality is Real, or his Lordſhip very unaccurate in attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Perſonal Pronoun to every one of the Three, and ſo is at his choice either unaccurate, or ſelf-contradictory, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or, for the ſake of a bleſſed Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, all together.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49695:17"/>
               <p n="9">§. 9. Let us now conſider his Lordſhip's proper Tradition of this third Opinion, or perhaps his own under the Colour of that, for 'tis not eaſie to find him. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is in general the Sum of the Received Doctrine, that in God's undivided Eſſence there are Three really different from each other, that are more than three Names, Oeconomies, or Modes.</hi> But here is not one word of Perſons, though aſſerted by the whole Catholick Church, by our own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Liturgies, which his Lordſhip has ſworn his unfeigned Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, and is by his Station bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and for which he has the great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his late Metropolitan. What latent Ulcer is the Cauſe of this tergiverſation I cannot exactly tell, but ſomething there muſt be at the bottom. But ſince this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Faith, muſt be taught every Proſelyte before Baptiſm; let us ſee what efficacy his Lordſhip's <hi>formula</hi> will have when put into a Catechiſm. <hi>Catechumen.</hi> My Lord, I am an Heathen Philoſopher, and willing to be inſtructed in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Chriſtian Faith; I pray what are they? <hi>Biſh.</hi> Firſt our received Doctrine is, That in the ſingle Eſſence of God there are Three. <hi>Catech.</hi> Three what, my Lord? <hi>Biſh.</hi> Three really diſtinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Perhaps the Catholick Church may not really mean that they really are what ſhe calls them, that is, Perſons; and hence your Lordſhip thought fit to omit it; I pray, my Lord, deal openly with me, is it ſo, or how is it? <hi>Biſh.</hi> Truly, Sir, the Church only means that one is not the other; that is, all that is intended in the Term Perſon. <hi>Catech.</hi> This looks very Catachreſtical and Inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; but do not your Scriptures teach them to be Perſons? <hi>Biſh.</hi> No, they only call them by the Names of Father, Son or

This muſt be the Iſſue of ſuch a dry, ſenſleſs, inſipid State of the Faith, if offered to the Wiſe of the Heathen. Whereas the true Theory of the Faith is a moſt noble and ſeraphick Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy accounting for Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all other Myſteries of Nature and Grace in ſo clear and heavenly a Light, that all the Idolatrous Notions and Fables of the Heathens, and all the celebrated Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Philoſophers, like <hi>Dagon,</hi> fell before it.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Come we next to his Lordſhip's account of the Incarnation.<note n="†">P. 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſecond of this Bleſſed Three was united to a perfect Man, ſo that from the Humane and Divine Nature thus united, there did reſult the Perſon of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49695:19"/>Meſſias, who was both God and Man.</hi> Now here it is to be noted, that this Expoſition of our Faith is his Lordſhip's own, after his Cenſure of the Primitive Doctrines herein, ſo that we muſt take this as moſt correct and exact. He then that hitherto omitted in his own accounts the Term Perſon in his Doctrine of the Trinity, admits it here concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and conſequently leaves us to conclude, that he judges it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be applied to the Trinity, but proper to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or God Incarnate. And ſecondly, it is notorious that he denies the Perſonality of Chriſt to be Eternal, ſince he aſſerts it to reſult from the Union of two Natures. 'Tis true, indeed, the Royal or Sacred Character of Chriſt is Perſonal, that is, it muſt ſuppoſe Perſonality in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo entitled; and it is certain alſo, that it was the Title of an Office of a Perſon to be incarnate, but this does not inferr, that the Perſonality of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> commenced or reſulted from his Incarnation. For an Eternal Perſon aſſumed our Nature ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our threefold <hi>Meſſias:</hi> So that though the Character and Offices of Chriſt reſulted from the Incarnation, yet not the Perſon, or Perſonality; for to this the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was aſſumed or pre-exiſtent, but added or contributed nothing thereunto. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49695:20"/>upon this news of a reſulting Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I ask whether the Son of God was a Perſon antecedently to his Incarnation, or no? If not, this is down-right <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> if he was, then that antecedent Perſonality did not reſult from the Incarnation; but if you add another from the aſſumption of the Humanity, then this is <hi>Neſtorianiſm;</hi> if you confound them into a compound, it is (I think) <hi>Eutychianiſm,</hi> ſince the two Perſonalities cannot be confounded without confuſion of Natures and Subſtances. But if in the Conjunction of Natures one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality excludes or deſtroys the other, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can reſult from that which is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that Perſonality ſimply remains (as it was before) that deſtroyed the other. And further the Perſonality that deſtroys muſt be ſuperior to the deſtroyed; and if ſo, it's ten to one but the Divine and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſonality of the Word is ſuperior to that of the Humane Nature, and ſo deſtroys it in the Union, and conſequently there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults no Perſonality from the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Eternal Perſonality of the Word only remains ſimply as it ever was; and thus at laſt truth will come upon us whether we will or no; for I do not ſuppoſe his Lordſhip will be ſo hardy as to teach, that a created Perſonality will deſtroy an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49695:20"/>uncreated by the conjunction of a created Nature with the Divine. Yet after all I believe his Lordſhip fixes the Perſonality, not in the whole <hi>Theanthrôpus,</hi> but only in the Humanity, if one could ſee his inſide; ſince he<note n="*">

                  </note> makes the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it ſelf a Perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Eternal Word that dwelt therein, and inſtead of confuting<note n="†">P. 32.</note> helps thoſe Criticks that place their firſt Conceptions of the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Humanity, and as to the Union he is ſo ambiguous, that he tells us not whether the Father and the Holy Spirit came into this reſulting Perſonality, or no, only ſaying without any peculiar reſtriction that God and Man became one Perſon, thus leaving a latitude for various Hereſies in this Myſtery.</p>

Now here are two great Abſurdities; firſt, that the viſible Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jehovah is in Scripture phraſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49695:22"/>called Jehova; and ſecondly, that this Name was applied to nothing elſe. For firſt, 'tis he that dwelt between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims in a ſymbol of Glory over the Ark, firſt in the Tabernacle, after in the Temple, is called Jehovah, not his very Habitation. 'Tis the Title of the Reſident, not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence; and ſo his Lordſhip himſelf applies it alſo in contradiction either to himſelf, or the Scripture, if he expounds it rightly. That which perhaps led his Lordſhip into this fancy is, that <hi>Shechinah</hi> Grammatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies Habitation, and is thence taken by the <hi>Rabbins</hi> in a ſenſe peculiarly ſacred for the Majeſtick Preſence of God between the Cherubims, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he takes to be called Jehova. But his Lordſhip was not at leiſure to apprehend that the <hi>Rah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binick</hi> uſe has turned the Grammatical nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Habitation, that is but an accident, and made it to import that ſubſtantial Light and Glory, the Symbol of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, the Scripture word Glory and the <hi>Rabbinick</hi> Term <hi>Shechinah</hi> being equivalent. For the <hi>Rabbins</hi> by <hi>Shechinah</hi> mean not mere preſence, but that Lucid Glory by which God preſentiated himſelf. But if his Lordſhip will excuſe this unacou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and ſay, That This Glory is called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova in the Scripture; yet this is alſo falſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49695:22"/>and will not ſerve his turn. For this <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah</hi> is called<note n="*">

The Glory is plainly diſtinguiſhed from the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah. For <hi>Moſes</hi> would not pray thus, O Jehovah ſhew me thy Jehovah, nor would the Jehovah ſay, my Jehovah ſhall paſs by. Jehovah therefore was not the mere <hi>Shechinah,</hi> either God's Habitation, or the Cloud of Glory, but he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlated himſelf therein. And hence the ritual Worſhip of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though performed toward that Cloud, was yet performed not to it, but to him whoſe Majeſty ſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in or by it. Nor does this Symbol ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equately come up to the Myſtery of the perſonal Union; for God's inhabiting in a Cloud of Glory did not make a perſonal
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49695:23"/>Union between God and the Cloud, as the in habitation of God in Chriſt; Humane Nature being of an higher and more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and unitive Connexion, did; which yet however doth not really turn our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt into Deity, except we will go over to <hi>Eutychianiſm,</hi> and a confuſion of Subſtance; nor do we adore his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as ſo Deified, but we Worſhip the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God united to, and mediating for us in our Nature.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But whereas his Lordſhip has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitched all Mortals in ſaying, That in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Phraſe Jehova never imports any thing elſe but a conſtant and viſible imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Inhabitation, which has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently baffled in the precedent Section, I will adventure to advance and ſay, that in the Scripture, the word Jehovah is uſed for God, without any imaginable reſpect to ſuch a <hi>Shechinah.</hi> In the Book of <hi>Job</hi> it is very often found, yet there being no <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah</hi> in his Land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z,</hi> the Author or Tranſlator could not uſe the term Jehovah concerning God appearing in the <hi>Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> was an Alien, and of the Line of <hi>Eſau.</hi> In thoſe infinite Places where the Creation, and all other Divine Works without the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> are attributed to Jehovah,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49695:23"/>there the name has no reſpect to the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah.</hi> Whereſoever he is mentioned by this name in Affairs among the Ten Tribes, after their ſeparation by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from the Worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there is no reſpect to the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> for he had no ſuch among the Ten Tribes. When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity before the deſtruction of the Temple mentions the Oracles of Jehovah, or God, by this name in the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> he has no reſpect to a <hi>Shechinah.</hi> When the Temple was deſtroyed, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any <hi>Shechinah</hi> reſtored to that Temple any more; yet the inſpired Pen-men after this call him by the name Jehovah, for which I referr his Lordſhip to the Bible or the Concordances. And to conclude, the Eternal Wiſdom of the Father ſpeaking by <hi>Solomon,</hi> calls him Jehovah, with reſpect to ſuch a time, as was before all poſſibility of a <hi>Shechinah.</hi> Prov. 8.22. <hi>Jehovah poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old.</hi> And truly if Jehovah were the name of God only as in the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,</hi> then as it did not belong to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> ſo it ceaſes to appertain to him ſince the extinction thereof in the diſſolution of the firſt Temple, except his Lordſhip will have it revive again by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Habitation of God in Chriſt's
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49695:24"/>Humane Nature. But then as often as it was uſed by the High Prieſt (if not others) under the ſecond Temple, and after the ceſſation of other Prophets, till Chriſt came, by his Lordſhip's Criticiſm it muſt be improper, and the Prophets that called God Jehovah after the Deſtruction of the Temple, did miſname him. But after all, to keep up an old cuſtom, his Lordſhip adds another contradiction; for he ſays<note n="*">P. 38.</note> Jehovah is a federal name of God: Now if ſo, then was it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly uſed of God all the while the <hi>Jews</hi> were in the Old Covenant with God, which was till the Death of Chriſt ſurely; and conſequently all that tract of time in which there was no <hi>Shechinah</hi> from the ruin of the firſt Temple, was this name moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. From the <hi>Jewiſh Shechinah</hi> come we to Chriſt, of whom his Lordſhip thus teaches,<note n="*">P. 40.</note> that <hi>Chriſt was God by vertue of the Indwelling of the Eternal Word in him;</hi>
                  <note n="†">P. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Jehovah dwelt ſo immediately and bodily in Chriſt Jeſus, that by that Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he was truly Jehovah,</hi>
                  <note n="*">P. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>that he was the true Jehovah by a more perfect Indwelling of the Deity in him than that had been which was in the Cloud.</hi> Now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49695:24"/>this muſt be grounded upon a Principle or Maxim, That whatſoever the Delty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inhabits (as it did the Cloud and the Humanity of Chriſt) that thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes God and the true Johovah by virtue of that Inhabitation; and therefore the Cloud and the Humanity of Chriſt were the true Jehovah by this Reſidence; and if ſo, the Cloud and Chriſt are ſubſtantially the ſame thing, though yet the Cloud hath ceaſed to be for many Ages. And by the ſame Doctrine the inner Sanctuary of the Tabernacle and the Temple, and much more the Temples of our Bodies and Souls, in which Chriſt as God dwells immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Holy Spirit, are the true Jehovah alſo by virtue of this Inhabitation. And beſides all theſe abſurdities, his Lordſhip's terms excluſively diverſifie the whole Chriſt who is inhabited, from the Eternal Word which does inhabit in him, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Lordſhip he becomes, if not a Socinian, yet a ſactitious God one way or other.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Ay, But does not the Apoſtle ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Lordſhip's form of ſpeaking, when he ſaith,<note n="*">

                  <hi>that in Chriſt dwelleth all the fullneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> which his Lordſhip<note n="†">P. 40.</note> cites for his Authority? Theſe are indeed the

For the Apoſtle ſeems to oppoſe the Gnoſtick <hi>Pleromata,</hi> excluding Chriſt from the Supreme <hi>Pleroma</hi> and Divinity. Now things are inexiſtent in others, either as things contained in things containing, or as parts in the whole, or one part in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt Mode cannot belong to the inexiſtence of the Deity in our nature; the ſecond or third form of inexiſtence may be conveniently aſſerted here. For firſt the whole Chriſt being a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of the Word and Manhood, the God-head of the Word may be ſaid to be in Chriſt, as part in the whole. But if you take Chriſt here Synecdochically for that part of him which is diſtinct from the God-head, which is often done, ſometimes expreſly, as the Man Chriſt Jeſus, ſometimes implicitly from the neceſſary ſenſe of the Texts, then this Text will be thus interpretable, In Chriſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Man Chriſt, or his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, dwelleth all the fullneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as the ſuperior in the inferior part of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and as the Soul in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But neither of theſe Senſes inferr, that all that in which the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells bodily, as a Soul in a Body, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49695:25"/>thereby really God and the true Jehovah, for this would inferr an Eutychian confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Natures and Attributes. To illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrute this, his Lordſhip may obſerve, that we ſay, an excellent Soul is found in this Man, either as part in the whole, or ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the whole Man is put only for the Body; yet no Man will hence inferr, that all that in which the excellent Soul dwells thereby becomes a true Soul, for this would confound the two Natures into one. And truly as the formal Structure of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's words is heretical, ſo his Arguments for it from the <hi>Jewiſh Shechinah</hi> are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and will juſtifie Idolatry (<hi>i.e.</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Worſhip) both in <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, the Fathers generally teach a gracious, adoptive, and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is indeed the common tranſlation for Jehovah; yet ſometimes it is put for other Hebrew words, both</hi> Elohim <hi>and</hi> Adonai, <hi>and that in the New Teſtament it is uſed rather in oppoſition, or more properly in ſubordination to the name of God, which ſeems to be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very plainly by St.</hi> Paul;<note n="†">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>when he ſays, there were many that were called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth, as there were Gods many, and Lords many. In oppoſition to all which he aſſerts, that to Chriſtians there is but one God the Father, of whom were all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jeſus, by whom were all things, and we by him. From hence it ſeems, that the true Notion of this according to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>is, that as the Heathen Nations believed ſome ſupreme Deities, and other deputed or lower Deities that watched over particular Nations; ſo we Chriſtians do own one only Eternal God the Creator and Conſerver of all, and one Lord to whom he has given the Government of all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49695:26"/>things. So that this, as it favours the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one exalted to Divine Authority and Honour, does take away quite the whole force of this Argument.</hi> Now let us ſee how his Lordſhip ſolves this. The ſum of what at large he tells us is,<note n="†">P. 37, 38.</note> that he that is at large the God of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, was alſo the federal God and Lord of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and his federal name was Jehova rendred <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as the Heathens alſo were ſuppoſedly under the Dominion of ſome of their Supreme Deities. So here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets one God for us, who is alſo our federal God, Lord, or Jehovah by his dwelling in the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt. But certainly 'tis hazardous to hang ſo weighty a point of Faith on ſo thin a Cob-web. For what, firſt of all, if a Man ſhould deny Jehovah to be a Name reſtrictively and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively federal to one People, how will his Lordſhip convince him? It is for the moſt part put by it ſelf, ſeldom with any Genitive, never that I have yet obſerved with a Genitive of that People. And being put ſimply it is a name of pure and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Eſſence or Exiſtence, and altogether irrelative even to the whole World, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to his Eternal Being before all Worlds. And yet it may conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import a negative reflexion on the Non-exiſtence

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, firſt let it be noted, that this was written not to Aliens or Infidels, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our Faith; for to ſuch, I confeſs, it had not been ſo perfectly clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, but to a Chriſtian Church, who all from the higheſt to the loweſt had been taught the myſtery of the Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words are as intelligible in their truth as the Apoſtles Creed or any other, which an uninitiated Heathen might eaſily miſunderſtand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conclude our Lord not to be God, as being not called God in the Apoſtles Creed, (which Hereticks and Latitudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians lay hold of to their evil Ends) or another God; becauſe in other formularies he is called God of God. But this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49695:29"/>Inſtitution, that we have no other God nor Lord than the <hi>Jews</hi> had, and that Lord of the <hi>Jews</hi> being only one God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, we cannot err in underſtanding this Creed of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other, to believe that Chriſt is a Lord in nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from God the Father Almighty. To exhibit this more clearly. I will ſet theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe of the Nicene Creed that are moſt appoſite to them, and liable to an Heathen miſconſtruction.</p>

               <p>Now to ſhew the moſt deſigned intention of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, and that they do not at all give any colour to the Socinian notion of one advanced to Divine Honour, but make him with God the Father Creator of all things, I ſhall digeſt them into a due Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, thus; <hi>For though the Heathen
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49695:29"/>Worſhippers of Idols have many celeſtial and terreſtrial Gods, as they call them, which they Worſhip by their Idols, their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their falſly ſo called Gods ariſing from this truth, that God hath ſet Preſidential and Tutelary Powers over us, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Office, though not by Nature, Gods and Lords, as the Angelical Princes of</hi> Greece <hi>and</hi> Perſia, <hi>and here on Earth the Kings and Rulers of the World; yet we Chriſtians have but one Almighty God the Father, from whom all things originally are, and we are in him, or for him; and one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tutelar Lord next God the Father, Jeſus Christ, by whom we were created, and by whom we ſubſiſt, for the Object of our Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> By this Paraphraſe it appears, that the Father is called God, and Chriſt Lord, but the Creation attributed to both in this form of diſtinction, that all things are of, or from God the Father as the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and by the Lord Chriſt, becauſe by him the Father created all things; and hence it follows, that the Lord Chriſt in that nature which created all things is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, and if uncreated, then of the ſame Deity of the Father, who by him created all things, and hence adorable with the Father; whereas the Heathen Gods, and all other Gods by deputation or advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49695:30"/>are not adorable, as not being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our Creation and Being, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created in themſelves. Whatſoever He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> our Lord Jeſus, being as our Lord and Creator, the Object of our Adoration is vindicated from the reproach of a Creature advanced to the Honour of Divine Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the very context it ſelf. And to this ſenſe the words were fully clear to the Chriſtian Church, who knew St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both as a <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> an utter Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to all Creature-worſhip. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I note here that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſpoken of Chriſt, anſwers not to the Hebrew Jehovah; for being ſet oppoſite to the many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it muſt anſwer to a word in Hebrew, that is capable of a plural number, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is not, for there cannot be a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jehovahs. But what ſhall be done to convince an Arian, who will confeſs our Lord a Sub-Creator of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide under the Father, and ſo their Lord on the Title of that Creation, though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was created by God the Father? Why this place muſt be interpreted by others, ſuch as that he is God, the true God, God over all bleſſed for ever, that he was ever in the form of God, and equal with God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49695:30"/>the Father, and one with him, all which will bear weight, while the federal whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie vaniſhes into ſoft air. And therefore after all his critical triſling, he wiſely<note n="†">P. 38.40.</note> comes to this way of interpretation, and ſays a great many Good and Orthodox truths on this Article ſo far as that that Chriſt was God, who manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelf in our fleſh, which being ſo diſſonant to all his former Modes of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and avowed Notions, ſeem to have dropp'd from him either unawares, or for a colour of defence againſt a foreſeen charge of Hereſie, or perhaps the ſingular Providence of God might ſo over-rule the madneſs of the Prophet, to make him ſpeak that for the Chriſtian Faith, which he had no mind to, that his manifeſt inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies might render him of no Authority for the uſe of Hereticks either in preſent or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. His Lordſhip's laſt Argument for the Deity of Chriſt is,<note n="†">P. 39, 40.</note> that the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Apoſtates from Chriſtianity never charged the Apoſtles nor the Church with Idolatry or Creature-Worſhip, which they would certainly have done, had the Chriſtian Principles been Arian, or Socinian. And had there been any ſuch Objection, we ſhould have had
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49695:31"/>the Apologies of the Apoſtles againſt it. For ſo we find them vindicating themſelves againſt the Charge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for quitting the Moſaical Ordinances, and calling the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> things of leſs prejudice than the worſhipping and Deifying a Creature. Now for my part, I believe it was the common <hi>opprobrium</hi> both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> and perfect Apoſtates, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a mere Malefactor, and that ſurely is an imputation of Creature Worſhip; and though we find it not in the <hi>Acts,</hi> or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Apoſtles expreſly charged; yet many paſſages aſſerting his Deity, ſeem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſet in oppoſition to ſuch calumnies. In the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles the recorded diſputes with the <hi>Jews</hi> are, whether our Jeſus was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> for on conceſſion of this, all the other Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were to have been admitted without ſcruple; and ſo the queſtions of his Deity and Adoration came not into courſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> while they denied this Truth, that was firſt to be proved in order to their conviction, that he was the Chriſt. And all that is written againſt Judaiſm in the Epiſtles, is againſt Judaizing Chriſtians, or Semi-Chriſtian Judaizers, that adhered to the Levitical Inſtitutes as neceſſary to all Chriſtians. Now theſe not making Chriſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49695:31"/>an Idol or a mere Creature, there was no need of a Vindication of us with them againſt an Idolatry that they charged us not with; but againſt thoſe Hereticks that made Jeſus a mere Man, and conſequently would impeach us for the Worſhip of a Creature, St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel and firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle were expreſly written; and theſe were a ſort of Un-Chriſtian Judaizers of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Characters from their proper Authors. So that his Lordſhip's Obſervation, though never ſo well intended, is however partly falſe, and partly impertinent. And yet allowing this Argument as much force as can be deſignedly granted it, it will amount to no more than this, That the Enemies of our Religion could not upbraid us with a profeſſed Worſhip of a profeſſed Creature, becauſe he whom the Chriſtians worſhipp'd in our fleſh, was by them owned to be the Eternal God: Yet no doubt the <hi>Jews</hi> ever did, and do at this Day charge us with the Worſhip of a vile Creature, who really (as they think) had no Deity in him; elſe, had they alſo thought him to be God, they had been <hi>ipſo facto</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, the want of this Faith being the only Bar to their Converſion; and the cauſe why they execrate both our Lord and us for this very Doctrine. So unlucky
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49695:32"/>is his Lordſhip, even in the faireſt part of this Diſcourſe, as if God had laid this Curſe on him, that he that had ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally handled the Chriſtian Faith in moſt part of it, ſhould not have the Glory or Comfort of having ſerved it in any one particular.</p>

               <p n="2">§. 2. This dealing with the Fathers is ſuch an indecent ſort of immorality, that 'tis not to be endured in one of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Character. The Fathers, it is true, were Men, and they have their <gap reason="foreign">

But it falls
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49695:33"/>out quite otherwiſe. For he Taxes them for no real obliquities, but their Catholick Principles; fixes on them ſuch Theories as they never dreamed of, and ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of their own avowed Faith, and this without quoting ſo much as one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of them; he gives them not ſo much as one good word, but finally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them to us as a parcel of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſelf contradicting Bablers; which how it conduces to the encouraging Deiſm and Hereſie, I humbly leave to the Cenſure of my Holy Mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Sure I am, as this ill office was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly needleſs to his Expoſition of the Faith, ſo modeſty ought to have repreſſed it; if for no other conſideration, yet for this one reaſon, That they may receive him into their Society with joy at the day, when he ſhall be gathered unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. The Buſineſs then of this ſecond part is to diſcuſs the truth and juſtice of his Lordſhip's Imputations caſt upon theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worthies, which he introduces thus, by telling his Clergy, <hi>that</hi>

And if his Lordſhip dares deny this reſpect of Eſſence to be taught by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning the Unity, I will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the proof of it. But if his Lordſhip be not ſo hardy, then let him recant this Impeachment of the Scriptures, that they have not taught us in what reſpect the Perſons are One. I am however content that Men of Candour take this only for an heedleſs ſlip, not a deſigned Artifice. Let
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49695:34"/>it be ſo; yet is it a dangerous one, and uſed by the Men of the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction, to the ſervice of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Comprehenſions. The Antapolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> owns the forequoted Text of St. <hi>John</hi> for undoubted; <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and theſe Three are One.</hi> This, ſaith he, is Scripture,<note n="*">
                     <hi>Antap.</hi> p. 5.</note> but how they are one the Scripture teacheth not. What is this fetch for, but that we may not preſs the Heretick's to own an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Unity, but whatſoever elſe will ſerve their ſeveral Turns, and deliver them from the Canon of the Faith? But ſecondly, his Lordſhip ought to have inſtructed his Clergy in what reſpects they are Three, according to the Scriptures, which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us herein, with certain notions and reſpects, by which they are diſtinguiſhed from each other in the Unity of Eſſence. For are not Father and Son Perſonal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and founded on a ſubſtantial ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, the Father being the Perſon Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant as ſuch, and the Son the Perſon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as ſuch? And is not the <hi>Logos</hi> the ſubſtantial Iſſue of the Eternal Mind, and as ſuch diſtinguiſhed from its Parent? The Holy Spirit is of the Father and the Son,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49695:35"/>and does the perſonal Offices of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete by miſſion from the Father and the Son, on which account he hath perſonal and diſtinctive Pronouns and Attributes given him. Which ſhews the form of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to be Perſonal, and the different Mode of their deſcent, origination, and miſſion. So much therefore of the Modes of their diſtinction being taught by the Scriptures, is alſo well taught by the Church, and ought to have been ſo by his Lordſhip; though other Modes of this Subſiſtence, that are not revealed, paſs our meaſures and capacities, and Men's inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick ſpeculations on them are not to be admitted for Catholick or Canonical.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4.

Now the Fathers all deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an emanation, which like that of Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in abſciſſion of Parts, will hereby be diſcharged from the fancies of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Emanations, which the<note n="*">P. 28.</note> Defender of Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s Notion of a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Unity charges with ſuch Abſciſſion in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Triad. We are not yet advanced to the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſick Viſion, nor the tongues of Angels, nor, if we were, could we adequately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the glorious Myſteries of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subſiſtences; yet God himſelf gives us leave to ſpeak of his revealed Truths herein according to our infirmities; that we, who ſee theſe Myſteries remotely and only by dark reſemblances, may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate thoſe notions in as remote forms of

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49695:37"/>Lordſhip ſhould call them Platonical in derogation to the Grandeur of the Chriſtian Theology; like the reproach of <hi>Amelius</hi> upon St. <hi>John,</hi> as if he alſo had preached the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. 'Tis true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers writing for our Faith againſt Gentiliſm, do often cite this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, not as an Author of our Principles, but as a good witneſs to the <hi>Greeks</hi> for their Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though ſometimes, when upbraided with him by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, they freely call him a plagiary of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Sacred Theology, which he afterwards cook'd up after a <hi>Greek</hi> Mode. Now the Corruptions in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine of the Trinity the Fathers uſe not, nor are pleaſed with, but thoſe ſeeds of true The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology that are in him, they love and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, not as <hi>Plato</hi>'s, but as God's; the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God having graciouſly permitted ſome Notions and Rudiments of Faith to be conveyed to the Wiſe of the Heathen, before the publication of Chriſtianity, to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49695:37"/>prepare a way for its after-reception and vindication among them. And having thus vindicated the Ancients in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of theſe Eſſential Emanations, let me obſerve how tectly ſly and abuſive his Lordſhip's Reflexion on them is: Some, ſaith he, were pleaſed with the Platonical Notions of Emanation, as if all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ancients had not the ſame Notions of Emanation, but ſome were for, and ſome againſt theſe Emanations. But here it had been fair to have graced the Margin with the Catalogue of the Emanatory and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emanatory Ancients; and I do here urge and challenge his Lordſhip to produce them <hi>in foro</hi> to ſpeak for themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſentence be paſſed upon them. This I doubt is an hard task, but a demand that cannot be denied me without ſhame. But it ſeems theſe Platonick Ancients were grown old unto Dotage, and become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren again, and as ſuch were pleaſed, poor Souls, with the pretty Baubles that <hi>Plato</hi> invented for them; and thus we have made a good beginning upon the Fifth Commandment, if the Senſe thereof may extend to the Fathers of our Religion, and the Church.</p>

But, perhaps, it was neceſſary to do that by oblique refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which it is not yet ſafe to do by open mouth to avoid an open conviction.

               <p n="6">§. 6. Let us now ſee how Heatheniſh his Lordſhip makes theſe Divine and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notions of the Fathers. † <hi>For,</hi>
                  <note n="*">P. 31.</note> ſaith he, <hi>we have footſteps of a Tradition, as ancient as any we can trace up, which limited the Emanations to Three. And theſe thought there was a production, or rather an eduction of two out of the firſt, in the ſame manner that ſome Philoſophers thought, that Souls were propagated from Souls, and the figure by which this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, being that of one Candle being lighted at another, this ſeems to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Riſe to thoſe words Light of Light. It is certain that many of the Fathers fell
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49695:39"/>often into this conceit,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſure I am, that I have ſet his Lordſhip's words in their due connexion with thoſe cited in the laſt Section: And are the reaſon aſſigned, why they exorbitated beyond due bounds that taught Emanations and Foecundity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Notion is Platonick and the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition heatheniſh and falſe. For thoſe (which his Lordſhip notes) who limited the Emanations to three, reſembled it to the imagined propagation of Souls, and lighting of Candles, and conſequently from theſe [Heathens] came our Light of Light. This is the true Grammar Senſe of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Words. For the Relative <hi>theſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Heathens only laſt before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the repreſentation by Souls propagated and Candles lighted, reflect back only on the Heathen Tradition, and is not this a great Credit to the <hi>Nicene formula,</hi> to have ſuch an heathen and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Original: The Diſcourſe to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is of an heathen Tradition, heatheniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded by the Similes of Souls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, and Candles lighted; for I dare engage no Catholick Author ever repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Eſſential Foecundity and Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Deity, by thoſe Figures of Souls and Candles, that thence probably his Lordſhip might be thought to have ſet
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49695:39"/>theſe as the Figures of Chriſtian Authors, of which he makes no mention within theſe words here cited. Afterward indeed he tells for certain, that many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fell often into this conceit, which he owns to be heatheniſh, and gives it no other original, either in Scripture or <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Tradition. The moſt that can be moſt favourably imagined (though contrary to the order of his Lordſhip's words) is that the Tradition was heatheniſh, though dreſſed up by Chriſtian Ancients under the Similes of Souls propagated and Candles lighted, <hi>for many of the Fathers moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fell often into this conceit,</hi> and ſo probably came our <hi>Nicene formula</hi> Light of Light. The upſhot then is; the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Emanation and Foecundity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and heatheniſh, ſet off either by Heathen or Chriſtian Expoſitors by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Similes of Souls and Candles, from which Figure of Candles probably came the <hi>Nicene</hi> form Light of Light. That this is the genuine ſenſe of his Lordſhip is manifeſt, for he accuſes theſe Principles as exorbitant, for this cauſe, that they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, and ſet off with ill Similes, one of which was probably the ground of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Confeſſion. For, if his Lordſhip will not own this ſenſe, let him declare, if
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49695:40"/>the Simile of one Candle lighted from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, give a regular notion of the Faith in the Doctrine of Emanations and Foecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If it does, why does he blame the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of thoſe Emanations, Foecundities, and Similes, as Men that have gone beyond due bounds, and fallen into theſe exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conceits? But if he will ſtand to it that theſe Doctrines and their Similes are irregular conceits, than the <hi>Nicene</hi> form has an ill foundation in his Lordſhip's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Opinion. But, before I come to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the true Originals of the <hi>Nicene</hi> form, I will examine the truth of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, whether many of the Fathers often fell into this conceit; that the Emanations in the Divine Eſſence are <hi>of the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ſome Philoſophers thought Souls propagated from Souls, or Candles were lighted from Candles.</hi> Sure I am, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Similes are not only improper, but contrarily diſſimilar to the Notions of the Catholick Theology. For this teaches a co-eternal Emanation of the ſecond and third Perſons, with a co-eternal and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Unity, and eſſential Dependence of the two latter on the firſt Perſon; but Souls propagated from Souls, and Candles lighted from Candles are neither coaeval, nor united, nor dependant one on the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49695:40"/>other, and ſo are fitter for an <hi>Arian</hi> than a Catholick Simile; though, I confeſs it not fit for all <hi>Arian</hi> conceptions neither. Theſe then being ſuch abſurd conceits char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon many Fathers, as often uſed by them, one ſhould have hoped for a large liſt of them, and the places cited in the Margin; but, alas! here is no ſuch dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either for the Student or Examinant. And for my own part, I confeſs, I never remember any ſuch conceit in any Father. Of the imagined propagation of Souls, I have not made the leaſt obſervation among the Fathers; but of what may ſeem to come near theſe Candles, or might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this raſh conceit of his Lordſhip for want of memory or care, I will here offer.

But note, he is ſo far from the Simile of two ſeparate Candles, or Fires, or Lights that his Diſcourſe runs altogether againſt them; and ſo in his judgment theſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Lights are no proper, or ſafe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous repreſentations, or originals for the received Light of Light.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. But here it is abſolutely neceſſary, that I examine what his Lordſhip ordered to be ſent me for his Defence in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. This was a paſſage in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49695:41"/>Apologetick ch. 21. <hi>Ita de Spiritu Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp; de Deo Deus, ut Lumen de Lumine accenſum. Manet integra &amp; indefecta mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae radix;</hi> (ſo I ſuppoſe his Lordſhip read out of Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>) <hi>etſi plures inde traduces qualitatum mutuens.</hi> In this imperfect Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will only tranſlate what is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for this purpoſe of his Lordſhip, <hi>viz. So</hi> (is Chriſt or the <hi>Verbum</hi>) <hi>Spirit of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and God of God, as Light kindled from Light.</hi> Now ſuppoſing this place exactly full to his Lordſhip's deſign, I ask, is this Doctrine true or falſe, good or bad? If true and good, why is <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other Fathers to have fallen into this Conceit? To fall into conceits is an expreſſion for giddineſs and error, not for Judgment and the diſcerning of great and true Myſteries. How has <hi>Tertullian</hi> gone beyond due bounds if this be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Theology? But if this Doctrine be falſe and bad, let his Lordſhip anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize it, and the Catholick Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ever owned it. But further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this ſtill to be the Simile of two Candles, whether good or bad; yet this is but one Author, not a Father, not every where ſound or conſtant to himſelf in theſe Theories, and this is but one place, which if a reproachful one, yet ought not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49695:42"/>the reputation of many Fathers as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guilty of the ſame, except thoſe other many Fathers and their frequent uſe thereof be produced againſt them. Again, ſuppoſing ſtill this to be a Simile of fire, yet how can his Lordſhip prove that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends two ſeparate fires; why not fire, or flame, or light in and from the ſame origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire, without diviſion or ſeparation, like the late adduced Simile of St. <hi>Hilary?</hi> Since what went before, and ſhall be by and by inſerted, brings the inſeparability of the <hi>Logos,</hi> under the repreſentation of this Simile? But after all, this is not a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile of Candles, or common ſeparate fires, but only of the Sun and its Ray. For thus runs the whole Simile. <hi>Etiam cum Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ex Sole porrigitur, portio ex ſummâ, ſed Sol erit in Radio, quia ſolis eſt Radius, nec ſeparatur ſubſtantia, ſed extenditur. Ita de Spiritu Spiritus, &amp; de Deo Deus, ſicut lumen de lumine accenſum. Manet integra &amp; indefecta Materiae Matrix, etſi plures inde traduces qualitatum mutuer is. Ita &amp; quod de Deo profectum eſt, Deus eſt, &amp; Dei Filius, &amp; unus ambo. Ita &amp; de Spiritu Spiritus, &amp; de Deo Deus, modulo alterum, non numero, gradu, non ſtatu fecit, &amp; à matrice non receſſit, ſed exceſſit; iſte igitur Dei Radius, ut retro ſemper praedicabatur,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49695:42"/>delapſus in virginem quandam,</hi> &amp;c. Which I will endeavour to tranſlate to the taſte of the Reader. <hi>Even when the Ray is dilated from the Sun, it is a portion taken from the Principal, but the Sun will ſtill be in, or within the Ray, becauſe it is the Ray of the Sun, neither is his Subſtance ſeparated by the Ray, but only extended. So the Word is Spirit of Spirit, and God of God, like Light kindled from Light. The Original of the Subſtance or Matter remains entire and unimpaired, though you receive from it many derivations of qualities. So alſo that which proceeded from God, is God, and the Son of God, and both are One. So alſo he that is Spirit of Spirit, and God of God, is another from his Original by Mode, not by Number, by Order, not by Nature, and he departed not away from his Original, but only proceeded. Wherefore this Ray of God, as he was ever in paſt Ages prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, deſcending into a certain Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. Here the beginning enters, and the end concludes with that Simile of the Ray, (which title of the <hi>Logos</hi> was ever before acknowledged) and there is no other. The ſubſtance of the Simile and <hi>Similatum</hi> are both in themſelves undivided, and ſo paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel; the firſt <hi>Ita</hi> joyns the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents to the Simile of Sun and Ray im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49695:43"/>foregoing, and repeated in the <hi>Lumen de Lumine accenſum,</hi> within the ſame period, as it is, or ſhould be pointed. And all the other <hi>Ita's</hi> coming after with vehement elegancy look back to this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, with which at laſt the whole Theory is concluded in theſe words, <hi>Iste igitur Dei Radius.</hi> This I think as clear as if written with the very Sun-beams. Ay! but if this <hi>Lumen de Lumine</hi> be not Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Candle, how comes <hi>accenſum</hi> to be uſed, which does not agree to the Emiſſion of the Sun Rays? No? What not by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, or a light and acute Catachreſis? May not a Man ſay <hi>Radii de Sole accenſi,</hi> as well as <hi>Lumen de Lumine accenſum?</hi> Rays kindled from the Sun, as Light kindled from Light? eſpecially on this Hypotheſis, That the Sun is a Globe of fire, as to the Eye it ſeems to be? On this notion I think it proper even without a Trope. But why will not his Lordſhip allow me a Trope (if the truth needs it) in <hi>accenſum,</hi> who requires it for himſelf in <hi>Lumen?</hi> For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Trope <hi>Lumen</hi> doth not ſignifie either Candle, or Fire; and if all the words muſt be taken in their Primitive intention, then his Lordſhip loſes his pretence, that this place ſpeaks of two Candles, or two Fires. But had it here really ſignified Fire, yet it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49695:43"/>does not hence follow, that it ſpeaks of two ſeparate Fires, ſince St. <hi>Hilary</hi> has found <hi>ignem in igne,</hi> and <hi>lumen de lumine accenſum</hi> in the ſame Fire. Which anſwer I ſhall give alſo, if any Man ſhall object that<note n="*">Cit. <hi>Bullo</hi> Defenſ.

                  </gap>, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Tatian</hi> both make a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity or production, and the Simile is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only thereto, not the eternal Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of its ſubſiſtence from the Father. Now the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed in this form Light of Light, hath reſpect to the Original of the Eſſential and Eternal Subſiſtence of the <hi>Logos,</hi> to wit, whence he is what he is, that is, God and Light, and defines that he is God of God, and Light of Light eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, not mentioning his Office in the Creation, till after other interpoſed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Being and Subſiſtence. And for the truth of this ſenſe in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, I appeal to the ſuffrage of all Antiquity. So then theſe places of <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Tatian</hi> touching only the proſiliency of the Son from the Father to create all things, by which the Co-eternal Wiſdom had a kind of probletick nativity of an actual Word, pertain not to the matter of this Light of Light in the <hi>Nicene</hi> form.

                  <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſay, that the Sun and its Ray are not two really, but only nominally? I grant he does ſo, but this in conceſſion to the pertinacy of the Opponents, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately urged this, that the Light of the Sun is <gap reason="foreign">

And yet what is it that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> illuſtrates thereby? Not the manner how the <hi>Logos</hi> eternally iſſues from and ſubſiſts in his Father, no, nor the manner of this proſiliency to the Creation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the non-diminution of the Father by this proſiliency, or non-ſeparation of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therein, and the ſubſtantial perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the <hi>Logos</hi> in the World, after this proſiliency, without revocation out of it back again: Whereas his Lordſhip fixes his Figures of Candles on the conceits of the Fathers, concerning the foecundity in the Divine Eſſence, and the eſſential Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the two laſt from the firſt. So then theſe places give no colour to that <hi>Opprobrium.</hi> But though this be a full anſwer, yet will I <hi>ex abundanti</hi> adventure

It is evident therefore, that though <hi>Juſtin</hi> greatly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Platonick Philoſophy before he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtian; yet after that he admired the Theology taught in the Church by Theories received from the Scriptures, in which alſo the better part of the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49695:49"/>the Sun.

This being then their celebrated and traditional Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, the next Curioſity was to enquire into his generation and deſcent.

                  <hi>Logos</hi> increaſed, the <hi>Jews</hi> quitted their former Theology of the <hi>Logos</hi> ſo far, as herein to admit <hi>Sadduciſm,</hi> and to deny his Sonſhip, Perſonality, and Angelical Miniſtration to his Father. And as <hi>Trypho</hi> himſelf looks on the pre-exiſtence of the Meſſias, as the Divine <hi>Logos,</hi> to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Paradox; ſo thoſe others that <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſays were willing to pre-occupate him with thoſe Anſwers which he there recites and refutes, ſeem to be perfect <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> in this Point of the <hi>Logos,</hi> and all Angels; and thoſe ſome of <hi>Trypho</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But whether they were <hi>Jewiſh Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> or ſome Hereticks of a pretended Chriſtian Character; it is plain they uſed the old Traditional Simile of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> was uſed in the old Traditional Theology of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and continued among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but was

                  </gap>. So that that which is moſt excellently manifeſlative, that is the moſt perfect and true Light. Of theſe there muſt be two ſorts according to the two great parts of the <hi>Mundane</hi> Syſtem, <hi>i. e.</hi> intellectual and corporeal, and of theſe the intellectual are really the nobler, and of theſe the manifeſtative Light of the Deity muſt be the trueſt and higheſt of all, upon which no <hi>Manichean</hi> darkneſs can border. Hence St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that<note n="*">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>God is light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all,</hi> which is originally true of God the Father, and as really true of the Son and Holy Spirit. For of the Son the ſame St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note n="†">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>That he is the true Light that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> and if true, then not Parabolical or Metaphorical Only. So that as the Scriptures teach the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49695:52"/>Father to be originally God, and the Son really God of God the Father, ſo when they teach God the Father to be true ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Light, and the Son to be true Light alſo, by immediate conſequence they teach the Son to be true Light of Light Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, like that Text which the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this purpoſe; <hi>In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light.</hi> So that our Light of Light is not the product of a Simile in two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, but a literal truth revealed in the Scriptures, and thence as truly taken as God of God. And we may as well deny the reality and truth of the Life of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to be the living God, though he himſelf ſwears by that Life, and atteſts the truth of it, as to deny that he is true Light, which is expreſly aſſerted of the Father, and the Son. Now the Son being what he is from the Father, here is literal Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for Light of Light, Light indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, yet Light true and eſſential. And from hence I dare deduce the <hi>Nicene</hi> form, inſtead of that Chandlers Shop, whence his Lordſhip's fancy had its illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Here then will I fix his Lordſhip in this Queſtion; Whether the <hi>Logos</hi> the Son of God be really what the Scripture calls him true Light, and Life? If not, I yield the Argument, but at his Lordſhip's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49695:52"/>peril. But if he really be, then the Creed is true without a Metaphor from Divine Revelation, not from humane conceits and adumbrations. As for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, I grant it a term metaphorical, but that is nor in the Creed, perhaps, becauſe a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, and the ſame like all Similes, below the dignity of the Hypoſtaſis repreſented thereby; but however this is nothing to his Lordſhip's pretty Simile, that he found out for the good old Faith and Fathers; but the Light of Light is as literally true, as any thing ſpoken of God can be, or is in Holy Scripture.</p>

                  </gap>, and the origination of the Son, and Holy. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, inſeparably in the Father on purpoſe to diſclaim and ſilence thoſe charges of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> which yet his Lordſhip does not bluſh to fix on them (in words to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered immediately) notwithſtanding their expreſs remonſtrances and demonſtrations to the contrary. And yet after all, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the cavils of the Hereticks had forced the Fathers into ſuch forms of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as might then appear expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and good <hi>ad hominem,</hi> which now in an Age of other apprehenſions ſeem not ſo,

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49695:56"/>Lordſhip here ſeems to juſtifie and ſecond the Infidels in that Charge againſt all the Fathers, who argued from the ſpecifick Homoouſion, and diſtinct Operations, which I think were well nigh all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, even <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who thus<note n="*">Ubi ſup.</note> argues, and yet diſſolves the Crime of <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> which his Lordſhip with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> lays upon them, but from which I have clear'd them alſo §. 11. But if divers Operations as well as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from a ſpecifick Homouſion ſeem directly to aſſert three Gods; how came his Lordſhip to grant ſuch a conception al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, that <hi>there may be three, that may have a diverſity of Operations as well as Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomies?</hi> For if he be no Tritheiſt in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this Conception, why does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on it as Tritheite in the Fathers? And yet his Lordſhip diverſifies the Operations much more excluſively (each of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) than any Fathers do, and in ſuch a manner as inferrs a Tetrad in the Deity, in which according to his Lordſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt be a ſecond Principle. For his words run thus;<note n="†">P. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>In the Divine Eſſence, which is the ſimpleſt and perfecteſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, there may be three, that may have a diverſity of Operations, as well
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49695:57"/>as Oeconomies. By the first God may be ſuppoſed to have made and to govern all things, by the ſecond to have actuated and been moſt perfectly united to the Humanity of Chriſt, and by the third to have inſpired the Penmen of the Scriptures, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Miracles, and ſtill to renew and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie all good Minds; all which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we firmly believe there is but one God.</hi> Now whatſoever acts by another is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that other by which it acts, and prior in the Agency by the order of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If then God acts by the firſt, which is the Father, that God is in Nature and Subſiſtence antecedent to the Father, and the firſt hath a former; and if God who acts by three be diſtinct from thoſe three by which he acts, there are then four Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts and Diſtinctions in the Deity, or elſe the three are not eſſential in the Deity, but only operant and unſubſtantial Powers and Qualities. Yet is it againſt Faith to ſay that God acts or creates by the Father, becauſe it makes him ſecondary by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowable conception, the Canonical Faith herein being that God original, or God the Father acts by his Son and Holy Spirit. But whether we make the Father primary or ſecundary, if we attribute the Creation to him excluſively of the <hi>Logos,</hi> and Holy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49695:57"/>Spirit, and the Inſpirations to the Spirit excluſively of the Father and the Son, and the Divine Operations in the Union of our Nature, with the <hi>Logos</hi> to the <hi>Logos,</hi> only excluſively of the Father and Holy Spirit, according to his Lordſhip's ſcheme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, we rove from truth, from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, from Catholick Tradition, which aſcribes theſe to the ſingle Perſons by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reſpect of Oeconomick Order, but not by an excluſive propriety of Operation. And, yet, though his Lordſhip recommends this conception, of ſuch a ſeparate Agency in his three Divine Anonymities, yet can he find no ſuch incongruities in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrines of thoſe his deſpiſed Fathers. But 'tis time to take breath, and conſider what reformation following extinguiſhed this <hi>Tritheiſm</hi> in the Catholick Church and Faith. Why, <hi>Others</hi> therefore <hi>laid another foundation in one numerical Deity or Being.</hi> Now what is this, but to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, nay, openly to aſſert that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fathers, that believed Emanations and Foecundity, and argued from the ſpecifick Homoouſion, with the reſpective Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did not fundamentally own one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Deity? And yet how could they that ſtuck to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, deny the fundamental Article of one God, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49695:58"/>yet all the taxed Fathers defended as the Faith of all the former Fathers, who made the Monarchy a fundamental Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and were herein exactly and profeſſedly followed by all their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors? Nay, the feature of his Lordſhip's reflexion ſeems to attaint all Antiquity of <hi>Tritheiſm,</hi> till after the Doctors of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Homoouſion and diſtinct Operations ceaſed, as not holding the Unity of the Godhead; for his conjunction <hi>therefore</hi> makes this Unity a <hi>poſt-nate</hi> Principle, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up upon the apprehenſion that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrines of the Church were <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theite,</hi> according to his Lordſhip's general Imputation.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. And now it ſeems high time to obſerve upon what fancies (for they are repreſented as ſuch) theſe <hi>Tritheite</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were reformed by theſe over-<hi>ſeri pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum nepotes.</hi> *<hi>They</hi> then <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note n="†">P. 32.</note> that the Sun beſides its own Globe had an Emanation of Light, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Heat, which had different Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all from the ſame Eſſence. And that the Soul of Man had both Intallection and Love, which flowed from its Eſſence. So they conceived that the Primary Act of the Divine Eſſence was its Wiſdom, by which it ſaw all things, and in which as in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49695:58"/>an Eternal Word it deſigned all things. This they thought might be called the Son, as being the generation of the Eternal Mind, while from the fountain Principle, together with the inward Word, there did ariſe a Love that was to iſſue forth, and that was to be the Soul of the Creation, and was more particularly to animate the Church, and in this Love all things were to have life and favour. This was reſted on, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dreſſed up with a great deal of dark nicety by the Schools, and grew to be the univerſally received explanation.</hi> So that it ſeems theſe conceptions, theſe reforming conceptions, are very novel, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine derived from them became not univerſal, but by the Definitions of the Schools.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. But before we come to juſtifie their due Antiquity, let us conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as his Lordſhip repreſents them, the <hi>Tritheiſm</hi> of the former Fathers were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amended by them. For in this Simile here are two Emanations from the Globe of the Sun, Light and Heat, which have different Operations, which if they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent different Operations of the different Perſons in the Deity, this reduces that <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> which the Simile was deſigned to avoid. So unhappy were theſe Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49695:59"/>Tinkers in mending the former Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will, which are only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Modes of thinking, but differ in their Character and way of Operation. All our cogitations and reaſonings are a ſort of Acts, in which we can reflect on the way how we operate. We perceive that we act freely in them, and that we turn our Minds to ſuch objects and thoughts as we pleaſe. But by another Principle, of which we perceive
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49695:60"/>nothing, and can reflect upon no part of it, we live in our Bodies, we animate and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them, we receive ſenſations from them, and give motions to them, we live and dye, and do not know how all this is done. It ſeems to be from ſome Emanation from our Souls, in which we do not feel that we have any liberty, and ſo we muſt conclude, that this Principle in us is natural and neceſſary. In acts of Memory, Imagination, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there ſeems to be a mixture of both Principles, or a third that reſults out of them. For we feel a freedom in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but as for thoſe marks that are in our brain, that ſet things in our memory, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with words, we are neceſſary Agents; they come in our way, but we do not know how: We cannot call up a figure of things, or words at pleaſure; ſome diſorder in our Mechaniſm hides or flattens them, which when it goes off, they ſtart up and ſerve us, but not by any act of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will. Thus we ſee, that in this ſingle undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Eſſence of ours, there are different Principles of Operation, ſo different as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and neceſſity are from one another. I am far from thinking that this is a proper explanation or reſemblance of this mystery,</hi> (and here I indeed jump in judgment with his Lordſhip) <hi>yet it may be called in ſome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49695:61"/>ſort an illuſtration of it, ſince it ſhews us from our own Compoſition, that in one Eſſence there may be ſuch different Principles, which in their proper Character may be brought to the terms of a contradiction of being free and not free. So in the Divine Eſſence, which is the ſimpleſt and perfecteſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, there may be three that may have a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Operations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tenderden</hi> Steeple and <hi>Goodwyn</hi> Sands! This is a worthy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile indeed (to ſupplant that ſcouted one of the Ancients) in which is no repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Logos,</hi> and its Parent Principle, nor of the Spirit of Holineſs that is in the Father and the Son, none of their co-eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, co-eternity, or order, all which are reſembled in that Simile which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines. But however, let us try the ſtuff, firſt generally, and then particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In the general view here are two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of neceſſity and freedom. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſiſts in our being, and its Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations of Life and Death, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Elective faculty of our Minds. Now, what can this reſemble in God, but the natural neceſſity of the Divine Life and the Operations, (if we may ſo ſpeak) by which the Son is generated from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Holy Spirit derived from both, and the liberty of all God's other
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49695:61"/>acts? But this cannot amount to a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor reſemble contrary or different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſince God's liberty of acting differs not really from his neceſſary exiſtence. And both that neceſſity and liberty equally agree to every Perſon in the Trinity, and ſo cannot reſemble their diſtinction. But now we will be more particular, and trace theſe Philoſophick dictates <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſo we may ſee the depths of them. Firſt then his Lordſhip cannot tell whether there be in us two or three Principles of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only if there be not three, be ſure there are two; ſo then we are ſure of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure for two, but not for three Principles, or rather Perſons in the Deity. This at firſt ſetting out is like to be a ſweet illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trinity! I doubt 'tis crack'd through ſome diſorder in its <hi>Mechaniſm.</hi> But whether two or three, they <hi>differ not like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will that are but different Modes of thinking.</hi> Now if we take Underſtanding and Will for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of actual intellection and volition, as his Lordſhip's compariſon of Principles to them ſeems to do, then I deny them to be Modes of thinking, ſince Principles are not the Modes of their Principiates, but give them to their Principiates. If his Lordſhip means not the Principles, but only the acts
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49695:62"/>of intellection and volition, then I deny volition to be a Mode of thinking. And whether you conceive the acts of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and will mixt or pure, yet according to the true abſtract diſtinctions of them they are not divers Modes of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Act, but Acts whoſe formal reaſon is ſpecifically different. Now as trifling as all this is, and ſeems to be, yet his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſeems to have had a great feteh in it againſt the Canonical Similitude of our Minds, leſt Underſtanding and Will, being near the ſame with Underſtanding and Love, and flowing from our Mind as its Parent, ſhould be thought a fair Simile for the Trinity; for this cauſe it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they ſhould be but two Modes of thinking. This being premiſed, our cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and reaſonings are acts of a free Principle, but our animal Operations are neceſſary. But what is this to the Theory of the Divine Nature? For theſe contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Operations proceed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of contrary Subſtances, Soul and Body; whereas the Deity is moſt ſimple and uncompounded, and conſequently cannot be repreſented by any <hi>compoſitum</hi> whatſoever, eſpecially a compound of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. Well! but neceſſary Operations of the animal Life, ſeem to be from ſome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49695:62"/>Emanations from our Souls. Very well! and do theſe ſeeming Emanations repreſent an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Emanations of the ſecond and third Perſon? I doubt not; for thoſe in the Deity are but two, but theſe of our Souls on our Bodies (if they were Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they are not) are very manifold. But if they be repreſentative Emanations, why then his Lordſhip here goes beyond due bounds in being pleaſed with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Similes of Emanations, or elſe theſe Notions are regular, and then why are the Fathers taxed for exorbitancy in them? But if theſe Emanations of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life are not repreſentative, why are they brought in here under the term of Emanations, to make us believe them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the Divine Emanations? So much then for a Dyad repreſentative. Now a Kingdom for a third. Well then we have in acts of Memory, Imagination, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a mixture of both Principles, (<hi>i. e.</hi> free and neceſſary) or a third that reſults out of them. As for his mixtures, I leave them purely to himſelf; but for his third reſulting Principle I am to ſeek. For it muſt be a Principle that is neither free, nor neceſſary, and ſuch a one is hard to be got for love or money; but however, that a Principle, neither free, nor neceſſary, ſhould
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49695:63"/>reſult from two, whereof one is free, and the other neceſſary, will I doubt bring his Lordſhip of mere neceſſity to the terms of a contradiction, how uncontradicted ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he affects to be.</p>

Let it then be noted, that that Mind, in which a vital and conſubſtantial
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49695:65"/>reaſon perfectly ſubſiſts, doth by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in one clear, intuitive, luminous, and Archetypal <hi>Idea</hi> diſcern all poſſible Forms, Eſſences, Habitudes, Powers, and Reaſons of things, and therefore very particularly all the diſtinctive forms and differences of good and evil. From whence there muſt proceed in ſuch a Mind and Reaſon a vital and eſſential Spirit (which we in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would perhaps call a Principle) of Holineſs, to wit, an eſſential Love of all the Forms and Reaſons of Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an eſſential averſation of all the kinds and degrees of Evil, this being but one and the ſame Spirit, having different aſpects on different objects.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49695:67"/>Archetypal <hi>Logos,</hi> or Architectonick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God the Father. And hence theſe ambiguous Fathers ſeem to have copied their Theories and Language, ſometimes calling the <hi>Logos</hi> Wiſdom, to wit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive, ſometime the Holy Spirit, as the practical Wiſdom of God the Father. And ſo there are learned Men, that ground the alledged homonymy of the Word Spirit in ſome forms of Scripture. But I, that think the Scripture as a Rule for Canonick Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, thinking it unſafe to fix any exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Senſes on the Terms expreſſive of the Trinity, without abſolute neceſſity, am apt to think thoſe Fathers called the <hi>Logos</hi> the Spirit of God ſometimes, through ſome Scriptures by them ſo miſtaken, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in that ſenſe to them, under a looſe and general Notion, that whatſoever iſſues from the Eſſence of God the Father ſo iſſues by a Spiritual Efflux, or elſe is of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Subſtance as the Father is, and ſo as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the <hi>Logos,</hi> Spirit of Spirit, and God of God. But ſince all theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers expreſly own a Trinity of Perſons, the third of which is ſignally characterized by the appropriate Title of Holy Spirit, there can be no doubt of the conſonancy of their Faith to the Catholick Doctrine, and to this Theory of it in the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49695:67"/>which to ſerve his Lordſhip I am here to illuſtrate.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. Theſe Bars being thus removed, we ſhall proceed to examine on what ground this Subſtantial Love of God is called by the name of Spirit. Now this word, though ſo very variouſly ſignificant, is however uſed either abſolutely, as when it's ſaid, God is a Spirit, or Angels are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits, a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Blood, and other ſayings of the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal intention in the Word, or elſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and attributively to ſomething whoſe Spirit it is, or is called. Of this latter form is the characteriſtick Title of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or Holy Spirit of God and Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Word Spirit thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively attributed to Beings ſimply imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial denotes an active Principle, Power, or Virtue in them, and this either Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, or Moral. Thus it is mentioned as a potential Principle; <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. as a moral Principle; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1.1, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. and 34.18. and 51.10, 17. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 36.26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. 1 <hi>pet.</hi> 3, 4. and ſo in infinite other places. So likewiſe the Spirit of God ſeems oft to denote in him, what we commonly call a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49695:68"/>Principle acting potentially, but chiefly and moſt eſpecially in the ſanctifical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of all which the Holy Spirit is the proper and immediate Spring and Original. Hence the Works of the Creation as attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Spirit of God; <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. and 33.4. where I ſee no reaſon to depart from the ordinary and canonical and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick ſenſe of the Term. From which places in my opinion we may beſt interpret, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Spirit of God moved or hovered upon the face of the Waters.</hi> In this potential way of Operation, the Spirit of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Prophets, Judges, and other Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their mighty Words and Works, that exceeded the Power of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as may be ſeen in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts of Scripture. Thus the Holy Spirit came upon the Virgin <hi>Mary, and the Power of the most High did over-ſhadow her,</hi> Luke 1.35.

I know the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, Crellius,</hi> and others make this poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit to be a created effluent Virtue; but the permanency of it in God, with its other properties and deſcriptions every where exhibited in the Scriptures, do evince the contrary, reaſon it ſelf alſo witneſſing, that God never was without an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Spirit of Holineſs, which may very properly conſiſt in the eſſential Love of God, than which what can be more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, active, influential, and productive? We ſee how ſtrong the Spring and Spirit of an ardent love is toward the moſt mighty adventures, and how infinitely more muſt it be in the Divine Nature, from which it gave Life and Spirit to univerſal Nature, and bleſſed every thing according to its order, and cheriſhes all things by a lively and penetrating Providence, and drives on

But ſuppoſing, that all theſe Texts had denoted a Principle created or inſtilled into us, yet here is no Perſonal Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof; whereas it was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Spirit of God in thoſe Texts, that Characterize him Perſonally, is a mere created Quality in us, and that it is no where otherwiſe, never any virtue eſſential
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49695:73"/>to God. For we need not deny, that the Holy Spirits and Principles, inſpired by, and from the Subſtantial Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, may ſometimes derive the Name as well as the Nature of that their Original, and the moſt Catholick Divines concede it; but where the Original Spirit of God is diſtinguiſhed from, and aſſerted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe Operations and Graces, there the Spirit cannot be thoſe very Operations, or Graces produced by them, as thoſe mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Virtues and Qualities muſt be. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. to 12. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Joh. c.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. In which laſt the Holy Spirit is ſaid to be in Heaven, and conſequently can be no middle Quality in us, and yet in Heaven perſonally diſtinct from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Word; which I take to be a good Argument from a good Authority in deſpite of Hereticks and defective Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; to which I could add very many more, were it neceſſary. But the truth is, the Texts alledged by <hi>Crellius</hi> do not all manifeſtly denote by the Spirit of God a mere created Virtue or Quality, but may (except ſome few to be by and by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) denote the eſſential Spirit of God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening upon Men, and creating in them the Spirits of Wiſdom, Vigour, Prophecy,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49695:73"/>Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And particularly where <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 33.4. ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit of God hath made me,</hi> he implies the prae-exiſtence of that Spirit before himſelf, and ſo not after effected in him, being indeed a Virtue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, not operated, but a precedent cauſe of the Operation it ſelf. And though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literal form of the Hebrew, the evil Spirit, that troubled <hi>Saul,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords evil Spirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.15, 16, 23. and 18.10. and 19.9. yet this may denote, not a divine Operation ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is not evil, but a wicked infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſonal Spirit, the Lictor or Carnifex, which God ſent to puniſh him. But if we keep to <hi>Crellius</hi>'s Notion, and let the evil Spirit here be a Quality effected in <hi>Saul,</hi> it muſt be from ſome inſpiring Agent, which, the Quality being evil, cannot be God, and ſo muſt be an evil Spirit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <gap reason="foreign">

And if ſo, how can it be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Term evil Spirit does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Perſon of the Evil Angel, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the effect of his infernal Operation? And as to the Spirit of Wiſdom, with which God had filled ſome Perſons for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Prieſts habits, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 28.3. it appears not to be that effected Wiſdom it ſelf, but the Divine Principle efficient
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49695:74"/>thereof from <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.1. Where God ſays, he had filled <hi>Bezaleel</hi> with the Spirit of God, in Wiſdom, and Underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the filling Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spirit of God is diſtinguiſhed from its effect, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Wiſdom and Underſtanding inſpired by the Spirit of God into him.

So that in all theſe places, I am verily perſwaded, that the Spirit of God ſignifies not a mere Divine Operation, nor a mere Virtue divinely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but a Principle and Subſtantial Power operant. But that the Term Spirit of God may be ſometimes put for the Grace effected thereby; nay, and that actions of Subjects are many times elegantly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Adjuncts (as it may alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the effect for the efficient) I ſhall not gainſay; but ſuch mere Metonymies do not preſently exhibit a formal <hi>Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poecia</hi> of thoſe Adjuncts or Effects without other technical Schemes, ſuch as uſually appear in Poetick or Dramatick fancies, not in ſerious Proſe, plain Diſcourſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactick Inſtitutions, eſpecially in the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Catechetical, and Inartificial Rules of Faith delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.

For individual and actually exiſtent effects muſt be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of individual and actually exiſting Cauſe, or Cauſes, not from mere Genus and Species, which are not the ſubjects of Hiſtorical Relations. For it cannot be ſaid of Subſtance, or Body in general, that one and the ſelf ſame Subſtance, or Body produces all Phyſical effects in the material World, nor of Man in Specie, that one and the ſelf ſame Man performs all the Acts and Offices that are done by all and every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Man. Nor is Genus and Species capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Perſonal Unities and Diſtinctions. But now the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes both the Operations and Effects of one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, both from themſelves, and that Spirit, not only numerically, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically, and yet aſſerts them the products<note n="*">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> of one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, one and the ſelf ſame Lord, one and the ſelf ſame God; ſhewing at
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49695:75"/>leaſt the Unity of the Spirit, to be ſuch, and the ſame, as is the Unity of the Lord and God, which muſt be therefore moſt perfectly Individual. But if each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Divine Inſpiration, or its produced Graces had been ſo many diſtinct Holy Spirits of God in themſelves, ſince there are ſuch multitudes, and multiplicities of them, there was no reaſon why in the ſame breath he ſhould aſſert them many and manifold, and yet but one operant Spirit only, which therefore muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from them as the Cauſe from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the Author from the product, and as the Donor from the gift.</p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. His ſecond ſort of Unity is that of Origine, by which he pretends the Spirit to be called One, becauſe though infinitely manifold, or diviſible in it ſelf, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from one God, and in this reſpect may be called One. But neither will this laſt fit. For the Terms [one and the ſelf ſame] are too narrow, and expreſs a cloſer Unity, and cannot be applied to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable particulars that are only of one Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. For all particular Men cannot be ſaid to be one and the ſelf ſame Man, which performs all humane actions that are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Men originally deſcend from one Father <hi>Adam:</hi> Nor can all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49695:76"/>be ſaid to be one and the ſelf ſame <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that deſtroyed the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becauſe they all deſcended from one Father <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Nor can all the <hi>Socinians</hi> be called one and the ſelf ſame <hi>Socinian,</hi> that wriggles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a thouſand tricks and turnings, becauſe they all deſcended from one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or Father <hi>Fauſtus</hi> (for I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with <hi>Laelius.</hi>) But in truth, if there had been a vaſt number of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God, and theſe but mere Qualities, to which Perſonal Names, Pronouns, and Predicates are ſo often attributed in the ſingular number of one Holy Spirit, on the ſcore of a mere generical or originary U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, why do we never plurally read of many ſuch Holy Spirits of God ſo perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated according to this invention, with an open acknowledgment of their Plurality, and ſometimes of their Imperſonality; but only of one ſuch Holy Spirit, under ſuch Perſonal Titles and Deſcriptions? Or why had not the Article of the Holy Spirit in the Greeds been always taught and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to this pretty novel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation? Since the Church ought to have been taught and dealt with plainly, and not tricked into mazes or impieties by Figures, Fetches, and Sophiſtries more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous and involved than the Devil's Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

To this, I hope, to give ſo juſt and candid an anſwer as may embolden his Lordſhip to joyn in the Litany hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and to ſpeak clearer next time in his Theological Eſſays. The name Perſon, or whatſoever anſwers thereto in the learned Languages, firſt of all ſignifies a Man's Face, natural and artificial, and thence the whole ſingle Man; hence after were the Gods in profane, and intellectual Spirits in ſacred Writings repreſented perſonally, and ſo now the Term Perſon agrees to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle intelligent Beings by common and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial uſe.

Firſt then, Perſonality is a Character only of what is ſubſtantial and intellectual, as are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete, who therefore have a good ground of bearing thoſe Perſonal Titles.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49695:81"/>primary Right and peculiar Excellency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, ſince earthly Perſons change their Character, being one while Sons, other while Fathers and Sons, other while Fathers only, and other while nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Perſonal Diſtinctives of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit are taken from his connatural O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and Offices, which are Perſonal, and the Titles therefore appoſite. Now that the eſſential Reaſon and Spirit of God the Father, ſhould each be as equally Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves confeſs the Father to be, will hence appear ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for that they are conſubſtantial with him, and as ſubſtantially Divine as that Eternal Mind, from, and in which they are, and live, without any inequality in their Nature, Perfection, or eſſential Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And therefore, if one be diſtinctly Perſonal, ſo muſt the others alſo. And therefore the Pronoun <hi>He,</hi> firſt belonging to God original, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Father, as the firſt Perſon, is properly alſo communicable to the other Perſons, each of them deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Deity and Perſonal ſubſiſtence from him, with peculiar reaſons of their proper Perſonal Characters and Diſtinctions.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49695:81"/>the ſecond and third Hypoſtaſis as perſonally as the firſt, for otherwiſe a Perſonal Diſtinction and Notion of one, and Imperſonal Diſtinctions of the others, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, muſt have ſet them as une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, ſpecifically different, and heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in the ſame Deity, and conſequently not conſubſtantial or co-eſſential; for that the Imperſonals muſt have been in nature inſeriour to the Perſonal; which would make a moſt corrupt mixture, a moſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and monſtrous anomaly in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>

But perhaps ſome Men, with whom no diverſities are taken for true, but the ſeparate, groſs, and material, may cenſure this Diverſity between the Eternal Mind, Reaſon, and Holy Spirit of Love, ſo then, notional, and imaginary, that it cannot ſuſtain, or ground any Characters perſonally diſtinctive, without a very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and abuſive impropriety. Now if my Lord, or any other be in this prejudice, let them note that there is a certain true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity between them, and ſuch as we can ſomewhat conceive from the Shade we have of it in our own Souls; Whence a ſedate Theory will conclude, that the true and proper Modes of this their diſtinct ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in the Unity of the Godhead are in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49695:82"/>themſelves moſt perfect, and clear, and as Illuſtrious as the Individual Glory of the Divine Eſſence, which one day it will be our Heaven and Happineſs more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to view in the fulneſs of indiſtant Light, if at preſent we will be content to learn our Theories from God's Tradition, and not preclude our ſelves from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed capacity, by a wanton and affected infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for to this glorious intuition this Faith prepares us, by cleanſing us from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Providence, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the nobler Theories of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Powers of its Author, and exciting us to an active hope and purſuit of that Glory and Happineſs that conſiſts in the uninterrupted Viſion of God.

Now what ſhall we do? how ſhall we behave our ſelves between theſe contrary extremes? To the Anti-Myſteriſts therefore, I reply, That if it be hereby made intelligible, they have no reaſon to quarrel at it, ſince their only complaint for their infidelity is, that it is unintelligible.

Let it therefore be deep and recondite, while it is rich and noble; the treaſure is the better for its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and what is to be gotten is with joy to be communicated to ſuch as have Ears to hear. Tell but a Man that there are three in one, and one in three, without any other Theories, how dry and infant muſt that Notion be? How little life and taſte is there in ſuch a Rudiment? But when a Man is brought by heavenly Theories of the <hi>Logos</hi> to have ſome apprehenſions of the ſuper-eſſential Excellency of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and almoſt to feel the vital Love of the Holy Spirit, to view hereby the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of the Creation, and the Schemes of Providence in the Ray of Light Eſſential, in the Archetypal Tables of the Almighty Mind, this is Tranſport, this is Aether, this is Heaven it ſelf, to which we are waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up by theſe depreciated Senſes of the Fathers.

But whereas there are, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Catholick Faith themſelves, would yet open the Church Doors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions, by making the Goſpel, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Religious Councils naked unto ſhame, and contriving to abrogate the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Faith, I pathetically beg them to conſider deeply what I have ſaid hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially in the four laſt Sections, and further remark, that ſince by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, and the Mediation of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49695:85"/>Son, we have an acceſs unto union with God the Father, the firſt Parent and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all, that dwells in Light otherwiſe altogether inacceſſible, it was neceſſary that our Rule of Faith (if juſtly perfect) ſhould ſhew us the way of this aſcent, and particularly what that <hi>Logos,</hi> and Holy Spirit properly and eſſentially are, by whom we ariſe into this Communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Elſe ſuch a defect had remained in theſe neceſſary Notices, as had rendred our Faith and Theology blind and uncertain to the inevitable danger of a fundamental Impiety. For Men, hearing of the Son and Holy Spirit, muſt have been curious for a Notion of them, and muſt have taken them for create, or uncreate. Now if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncreate Men had taken them for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (as we ſee many will againſt expreſs Revelation, and univerſal Tradition to the contrary) Men would have proſaned them and their Deity, the ſault whereof had been imputable to God, had he not yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us the neceſſary Revelation of their Order and Godhead. And ſo likewiſe had they been created, God would not have left us without ſufficient notice thereof, leſt we miſtaking ſhould have adored them for Divine, as the whole Church hath done, and does. But certainly he could not ſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49695:85"/>much, ſo fully, ſo often, ſo perpetually have aſſerted their Godhead, and Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, had they been merely created, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſonal. To have revealed nothing of them had been to have ſhewed no way to Communion and Knowledgge of God the Father, and to have ſaid ſomewhat of them, but not enough to fix a Faith and Notion of their Eſſence and Character, had been a Snare. But ſince what is now taught, is both neceſſary and perfect, I think it a damnable Sin not to keep ſuch a Divine <hi>Depoſitum</hi> perfect, whole, and undefiled as it was delivered unto us, but by falſe indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of Latitude to betray it up to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation, corruption, contempt, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>

But our Life is a Warfare, and his Lordſhip's further proceſs requires my further attendance. <hi>But many</hi> (ſaith his Lordſhip) <hi>have thought, that the Term Son did not at all belong to the<note n="*">He means to any one of them.</note> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Three, but only to our Saviour, as he was the Meſſias, the</hi> Jews
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49695:86"/>
                  <hi>having had this Notion of the Meſſias, that as he was to be the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſo he was to be the Son of God. We find</hi> Nathanael <hi>addreſſed himſelf thus to him, and when the High Prieſt adjured our Saviour, he knits theſe two together, art thou the Chriſt the Son of the moſt High God?

Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. For theſe are that great and good Doctor's words;—<hi>the learned</hi> Jews <hi>themſelves reſolved, that he was to be the Son of God, and that in an eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; (So the High Prieſt,</hi> Matth. 26.63. <hi>Tell us, whether thou art the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> and Joh. 1.49, <hi>Rabbi thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael,</hi>) &amp;c. Which Text therefore the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically interprets of his reſurrection and exaltation according to good New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Authorities. But he that ſaid this, never taught his Lordſhip that the term Son did not at all belong to any of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Three, but expreſly in the ſame Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation proves from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. that he was declared to be the Eternal Son of God (the ſecond of the bleſſed three) by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49695:86"/>from the dead. And it is not fair play in his Lordſhip to cite a place and conceal the Author, that ſo God's truth, and his doubling might not be diſcerned. But ſince we are upon a critical diſquiſition of theſe terms, <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Son of God, we will conſider firſt what the real truth is; and ſecondly the opinion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Firſt then it is certain, that God's conſtitution of any Perſon in a State of favour gives the favourite the Title of a Son by virtue thereof. Thus God calls the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> his Son, and his Firſt Born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 22. and ſo literally; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.1. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places ſet God as their Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had admitted them as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> into his eſpecial Covenant, as we are alſo Sons of God by the adoption of the New Covenant. And hence exaltation by God to an high Authority has founded a title of Gods, and Sons of God, unto Men, and Angels. And conſequently the various ſignal Exaltations of Chriſt in his Humane Nature, above all others make him in thoſe reſpects juſtly to be ſtyled the Son of God. If then he had been only exalted into the heavenly Throne, without any antecedent Death or Reſurrection, this alone would have founded a Filial Title, much more
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49695:87"/>when in Order thereto, he was born again our of a Virgin Sepulcher, whereby he became the firſt Born, or firſt Begotten from the Dead. So his Transfiguration on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and his Unction by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt at his Baptiſm (in both which the <hi>Bath-Col,</hi> the voice from Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him God's beloved Son) were fair grounds for the ſame Character.

By the Teſtimony of the Fathers from after <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s days, it appears an eſtabliſhed or received Doctrine among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as alſo other Hereticks herein ſo judaizing, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be a mere Man, and ſo no wonder if all <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſince, that own him to be the Son of God, take him only for a poſitive or adoptive Son by mere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. Now if his Lordſhip thinks this to have been their Faith alſo in our Lord's days, then thoſe ſome Criticks of his Lordſhip's cannot found the Filiation of the <hi>Theanthropus</hi> in this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith. But if theſe <hi>Jews</hi> did believe their expected <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> to be a real <hi>Immanuel</hi> according to their Prophet, and this <hi>Immanuel</hi> to be the Son of God, how can his Lordſhip's Criticks prove that in the <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>'s Filiation<note n="*">

For if there were another Conception of Sonſhip in the Divine Nature, how can they, or his Lordſhip prove it to be poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that in the Humanity? To be Son of God is a Character at leaſt of Dignity, and if there be any thing in the Deity that bears it, it cannot derive it from any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49695:88"/>and ſo in order of Conception it ought not to be poſterior to the Title in a Creature. His Lordſhip had beſt have a eare, leſt he and his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick's<note n="*">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49695:89"/>of God to be a Perſon not Humane, but equal to the Father, and ſo had no firſt Conceptions of it in Humane Nature The Perſonal Title of Son, with others, that <hi>Philo</hi> gives the <hi>Logos,</hi> which he did not believe to have been incarnate, is a full proof of this firſt point, that he was called Son by the <hi>Jews</hi> without any reſpects to Humanity, ſince he taught this as the Theology of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Tradition of the Elders; and that this Filial <hi>Logos</hi> was by them believed equal to God the Father.<note n="*">

And even <hi>Joſephus</hi> after the Deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> owning our <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be Chriſt, doubts whether it were lawful to call him a Man, becauſe the old Notion, that God was, and was to be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was not yet worn out. They looked on the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as the Kingdom of God, and they looked for the Son of God (whom <hi>Agur</hi> of old knew under that Character) to come, and ſet up his Reign among them, and to ſubdue all Nations
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49695:89"/>thereunto. And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> ſhews him, and the Devils confeſs him the Son of God alſo as well as his Diſciples; nay, the Conturion at his Crucifixion owned him to be the Son of God; who never ſaw him to have been, nor ever hoped to ſee him hereafter to be the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to their Notions of his Royalty. For though they looked on their King to come to be God, the Son of the Father, yet they took his Kingdom to be ſecular. And he that conſiders, that in the Goſpels the terms of Father, Son, and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are ſpoken of to, and by the <hi>Jews</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, without any of our Lord's corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notion, or Inſtitution of any other, either in common among the multitudes, or privately among his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, muſt reſolve that the true notion of theſe three Perſons was popular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by an indubitate and good Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe our Lord and his Apoſtles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a recondite Notion of them unexplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, could not be underſtood by that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nor could <hi>Nathanael</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and others have made a right confeſſion of Faith, without any preliminary Catechiſm of the Notion, had it not been general? And in vain had God the Father at his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49695:90"/>Baptiſm declared him to be his Son, in whom he was well pleaſed to all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, had they been Strangers to the true ſenſe of the Title, which imported not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Royalty, but an<note n="*">Matth. <hi>4.</hi> Mar. <hi>1.</hi> Luke <hi>4.</hi>

And
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49695:90"/>here, indeed, there lies a large and noble Field before me for a Theory, concerning the Titles of Chriſt, Lord, King of <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> on what grounds they ſtand in the Divine and Humane Nature, wherein might be ſhewn that neither are the firſt Conceptions of all theſe in our Lord's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to the utter ruin of Criticiſm; but it being not here neceſſary, and withal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of a large ſpeculation, I wave it in this place; and the rather, becauſe, if my unhappy Eyes will hold out ſo far to ſerve my deſigns, I intend a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the Kingdom of God, in which theſe Titular Characters of our Lord will be largely diſcuſſed. In the mean time, I am ſorry his Lordſhip's Criticks are ſpoiled in their kind aims to explain the Texts, that teach the inferiority of Chriſt as Man to the Father; but I am pretty well pleaſed however, that the Catholick Doctrine has no need of ſuch new faſhioned planes to ſmooth its difficulties.</p>
               <p n="40">§. 40. But now at laſt the Scene opens, and the whole myſterious intrigue comes out, why all this pother is made. For ſaith my Lord,<note n="*">P. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>If this be true all the Speculations concerning an Eternal Generation are cut off in the ſtrict
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49695:91"/>ſenſe of the words, though in a larger ſenſe every Emanation, of what ſort ſoever, may be ſo called.</hi> But was it my Lord's part to leave this in ſuſpenſe, whether it be true or no? To leave hereby a liberty to deny the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his Father before all Worlds? Would not common honeſty oblige a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Profeſſor to determine one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, between the inconſiſtent Fathers, and theſe ſagacious Criticks, either for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Eternal Generation? and yet to let us ſee which way he inclines, he brings Texts of Scripture perverted for the ſenſe of Hereticks, but not one ſacred ſyllable for the Fathers; nothing but faſtidious and expoſing Cenſures. Yet this was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. The diſtinct Emanations of the Son, and the Holy Spirit were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, though one be from the Father only, and immediately, the other from the Father and the Son, as we Weſterns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; or, to ſpeak more like the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the Father by the Son; that ſo the Emanation of the Holy Spirit being in a larger ſenſe called Generation, the Holy Spirit may in a larger ſenſe be called the Son of God: And ſo God the Father ſhall have improperly two Sons, but really
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49695:91"/>none at all till the being of Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49695:92"/>that may either glory in it, or be beguiled by it, I will anſwer it in order. Firſt then all theſe traduced Theories of Faith are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally profeſſed, and received in the whole Church of God, and have but a very few Adverſaries: And we have reaſon to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this univerſal Conſent herein to the Piety and Labours of the Ancients, who ſo victoriouſly defended it againſt the Higheſt Parts, Principalities, and Powers. For whatſoever failures and leſſer miſtakes (from which no mortal is, or can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure) may ſometimes appear in a courſe of nice Diſputations, yet the main Body of them appeared ſo ſtrong and convincing, that they bowed down the whole World into Conviction: I mean the Chriſtian World; while the Adverſaries thereof have deſervedly attained the glory of preparing the way for <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> What matter then is it if theſe Divine Theories (which his Lordſhip opprobriouſly calls ſubtilties) be abuſively repreſented by wicked Men? Does it follow that the Theology is vicious, and to be quitted? Such Counſel as this would ſoon have ſtrangled the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which at firſt was every where traduced. What they, if that Impoſtor <hi>Sandius</hi>

                  </gap> from Grandſire <hi>Kalentine,</hi> and his <hi>Symmyſtae.</hi> Well, to go along with his Lordſhip, how came the poor old doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fathers to nod thus? His Lordſhip tells us, 'twas becauſe 'twas long before theſe Theories were well ſtated and ſettled. And here I had been at a ſad loſs for an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> of this ſettlement, if I had not by good fortune met with Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Letter of Remarks upon the two ſtrong Box Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, where he tells us thus: <hi>It ſeems plain, that the Fathers before the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>believed the Divinity of the Son of God to be in ſome ſort inferiour to that of the Father, and for ſome Ages after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Nice <hi>they believed them indeed both equal, but they conſidered theſe as two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beings, and only one in Eſſence, as three Men have the ſame Humane Nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among them, and that as one Candle lights another, ſo one flowed from another; and after the fifth Century the Doctrine of one Individual Eſſence was received. If you will be further informed concerning this, Father</hi> Petau <hi>will ſatisfie you as to the firſt Period before the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>and the Learned Dr.</hi> Cudworth <hi>as to the ſecond.</hi> So then the Primitive Faith till the <hi>Nicene</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:49695:93"/>Council was, That there were two Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Deities, one of the Father, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Son, and that of the Son ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inferiour to that of the Father. From the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to the ſixth Century, they believed two or three different<note n="*">What is this but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> Beings, and theſe equal, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of one Eſſence than three Men that are of one common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But in the beginning of the ſixth Century, then their Eyes and Faith opened into one individual Eſſence; and then I ſuppoſe the matter was ſettled. Be this ſo for once; what will it amount to? That all the Fathers till the ſixth Century were Polytheiſts and Idolaters, not excepting the <hi>Nicene.</hi> When a Man thinks upon this he muſt needs confeſs it not<note n="†">Diſcourſ. <hi>3. p. 65.</hi> It were perhaps too invidious to ſend Men to <hi>Petavius</hi> to find in him how much the Tradition of the ſeveral Ages has va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the greateſt Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</note> only perhaps, but for certain invidious to ſend Men to the Jeſuit for a Calumny againſt the Primitives, and were ſo to Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> to make his Hiſtory of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But as for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi> and his Admirers, I think them all refuted by Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> beyond all poſſibility
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49695:94"/>of a reply; and as for the Arguments upon a Specifick Homoouſion cited by Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and others, I have above accounted for their innocency, §. 11. and proved, that though they argued from a ſpecifick Homoouſion through the <hi>Arian</hi> Cavils, (eſpecially to avoid the Charge of <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſm</hi>) yet they did not aſſert this alone, as his Lordſhip charges them. But now to come upon my Lord's blind ſide: In his Letter he ſays, the Poſt-<hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers were for an equality, and uſed for their Theory the Simile of Candles. In the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we are upon he ſays, the Simile of Candles gave riſe to the <hi>Nicene</hi> form Light of Light, and therefore muſt be uſed by the <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> Fathers, whom he aſſerts to be for an inequality. In his Letter the ſpecifick Homoouſiaſts are equalizers; but in his Diſcourſe the ſame are Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But here again I would ſain ſee the Simile of Candles produced among the <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> Homoouſiaſts, to whom in his Letter my Lord aſſigns it. Again in his Diſcourſe the Theory of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Love is ſaid to be conſequent or concomitant to the Doctrine of one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Eſſence. In the Letter this Doctrine commences with the ſixth Century. But
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49695:94"/>all the Fathers that I have above-cited for the Theory of the Wiſdom and Love of the Divine Mind, eſpecially §. 21. §. 23. lived long before his Lordſhip's <hi>Epocha,</hi> even in the fourth Century the very loweſt, and lateſt. But ſince his Lordſhip is become a Father, no wonder if he falls into contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions too againſt himſelf and truth too; for it ſeems 'tis of ancient preſcription with Men of that Character. But in ſhort, I thought all theſe traduced Theories to have been ever ſettled, and that ſettlement not begun, but continued and defended only by the Councils and Fathers in ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, according as ſeemed then moſt ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in reſpect of the Hereſies, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents then fermenting; which occaſions a ſeeming variety in forms of expreſſion, but no real difference in the Subſtance of their Faith, that ſo Men herein might charge them with mutual or ſelf-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And yet that which we ſtand for is not every notion of every Father, but what they all agree in, and ſuch are thoſe Theories which his Lordſhip hath expoſed as Exorbitant: Let his Lordſhip prove their expreſs contradictions each to other in theſe eſtabliſhed and received Theories, and then indeed he may more creditably
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49695:95"/>expoſe his Father's Nakedneſs, though that practice is but of ill and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſcription. But as his Lordſhip has upbraided the Primitive Tradition of the Faith and the Scriptures in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and the forementioned Letter, and loaded the Traditors with ſo much reproach; he has done what in him lies to diſcourage Students from reading or regarding them, and not only ſo, but he has put ſuch a Dagger into the hands of Deiſts, and the open Enemies of all Revealed Religion, as he himſelf will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to extort; for who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church, that ſhe received the New Teſtament from Men divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, when for Five Hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt her Principles were Polytheiſt and Idolatrous, and ſhe knew not the very firſt Rudiments of a true Faith, and when ſhe at laſt did ſo, yet fell into divers ſilly conceits and Similes about it ſince ſcorned and rejected by the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tribe?</p>
               <p n="42">§. 42. And now I am reſolved to end, though his Divinity affords much more corrigible matter: At the horrour whereof, I leave him to God's Mercy,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49695:95"/>and the Churches Prayers; but his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this ſtamp, either to his own ingenuous Recantation, or Canonical Cenſure.</p>
